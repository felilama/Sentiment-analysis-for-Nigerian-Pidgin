So the Prophet (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""O people, do not trouble yourselves too much. He Whom you are calling is not deaf or absent. Verily, He is with you, He is All-Hearing and Ever Near.""  Sahih/Authentic. - [Al-Bukhari and Muslim. This is the wording of Al-Bukhari]Churches need not sing and clap for outsiders to hear!Do your thing indoor and silently! Na so them talk for Bible in Matthew 6:5-7!And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward. But when you pray, go into your inner room, shut your door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not babble on like pagans, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.…Just because you are going scot-free now doesn't mean you're not guilty of the offense!

Like WTF man!   - I also discovered there are so many watery substance they take that are indigenous to our southern and Western northers, and one particular one called ""solution"" they usually take that makes them high.- Not to talk of the different weed the smoke. There is literally no kind of weed I haven't seen them puff! I even heard of some places where they dry lemon grass, grind it afterward and smoke.Every damn thing southerners do, the core north does as well and most double. Even their women are not an exception. They are just good pretenders.I won't even go into prostitution and some states that mostly come to Abuja to do it as a full time profession.

This nigga using you all to troll There is no where Yoruba is recodnized specifically. I live in the US and have family in the UK .The UK metro police started employing Yoruba speakers solely for the number of crimes commited by Yoruba speaking people in the UK so they wanted to be able to intercept and decode the calls . Because these criminals use yoruba only to speak on the phone in texts and in emails so the UK metro police had to find a way to intercept this. But here they are dancing as if it's a positive reason they are employed😂😂😂😂Don't believe me, contact the UK metropolice help desk ! This info is available to  the public. Yorubas are profiled in the UK as the number 1 tribe that commits all cyber crime from Nigeria.Reno is just exposing it all, we all know. At one point it was the Jamaicans. Go to Peckham and Kent na Yoruba gangs full there 🤣🤣Same way Italia police employ people who speak Esan in Palermo doesnt make my mum's people the main culture in Italy Which Nigerian here in America won't tell yoú the truth that the Yoruba run gangs here?. They steal cars everyday and ship to Nigeria, na their work ! Plus  Account hacking, Credit card fraud , identify theft that's what they do here in America mostly .

"He also said that the Lagos State Commissioner of Police had waded into the matter between Oluwo and Ibile, and, according to Hassan, the CP had asked all parties to look for ways to resolve the issues amicably while maintaining the status quo.“But Ibile on his own violated that stand of agreement. It was on the heels of parties maintaining the status quo and that issues should be reported back to the CP of Lagos State that Ibile took laws into his own hands.“He admitted on his own (social media) timeline that if not for God, Mr Oluwo would have been killed. He said Mr Oluwo was lucky to only be stripped naked,” the lawyer told our correspondent.Hassan, commenting on the viral video, said, “On that fateful day, Ibile came with his boys and some policemen and they meted harms and attacks and wreaked havoc, shooting sporadically with people sustaining injuries.“Oluwo and other workers on the site were beaten to stupor and stripped naked. They were all piled up and packed like sardines. They took them from that same spot, having stripped them naked, into the bush and wanted to kill them. It was just the intervention of two farmers who were passing by that saved them from being killed. And that’s what happened.”He added that Ibile is claiming assassination threats after attempting to kill Oluwo and others, wondering, “How can someone you beat to stupor with (the aid of) over 100 thugs and policemen be the one attempting to assassinate you?”Hassan further stated that Oluwo and others were taken to the Force Headquarters in Abuja where they spent two weeks before they were returned to Lagos “and Ibile went ahead to charge them to court,” after he (Ibile) had “taken the law into his own hands.”Reacting to the video showing the stripping of Oluwo and others, the Force Public Relations Officer, Nigeria Police Force, ACP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said the Lagos State Commissioner of Police was already on the case, assuring that the Lagos Police Command would update Nigerians on the matter.Adejobi wrote, “Lagos State CP is on this matter. We will do the needful, and justice will be seen to have been done. I am sure the Lagos State command will update us as and when due. Thanks.”Efforts to reach the Lagos State PPRO, Hundeyin, were unsuccessful as calls to his telephone were not answered for two days and a text message sent to him had yet to be replied to as of press time.Speaking with The PUNCH in a telephone chat, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Mr Gboyega Akosile, said the Sanwo-Olu-led government frowns upon the issue of land-grabbing in the state and is doing everything possible to curb it.“It is an issue that the Lagos State Government frowns upon very seriously. It is not something that the government is taking lightly considering what the menace does to society.“We’ve had several cases of land-grabbing and, of course, the government has waded in.“We have a department in the Ministry of Justice where land-grabbing cases are treated. And those that tend to be criminal in nature are taken up, and, of course, people have been happy because there are some people who have taken their cases through the land-grabbing department and whose cases have been resolved,” Akosile said.He encouraged those having issues relating to land-grabbing “to come to the government,” urging them not to “resort to self-help which may turn them also into criminals when they take up arms against those suspected criminals (land grabbers). Just come to the government and the government will help you with your land-grabbing case.”“The Ministry of Justice has a very effective and efficient unit that handles such cases,” the governor’s aide added.“The administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu frowns on the issue of land-grabbing.

Why on earth are you giving it to Toyota? Is there something I'm missing here? Is there information or context that I'm not aware of?Another user wroteSir, you are the only light LP have for now, and we will hold your feet to the fire, we will praise you when you do well and chastise you when you err. This is a No for us, we have Innoson and Nord that you should have patronized. Please do well and stay on course.Another used wroteYour Excellency Sir, we the OBIdients will praise you when you're doing well, but on this particular one with due respect Sir, why Toyota?

"Well, it's not as common as you think or portray. In fact, it might be that you're exaggerating.Personally, from my experience, I hold the opinion that in most standard academic setting, considering goes into a lot of things before they are played out. As such, it doesn't usually take undue time and the disseminated information usually prove fitly. For instance at Unilorin, they organized induction ceremony for their medical students late last month. The programme started around 10am and ended before 1pm - an occasion that attracted many academic elite far and wide. Another instance, inaugural lecture only starts around 5pm and end before 7pm here. This is another vital occasion that puts the elites together. Convocation doesn't take so long too. I expect this to be the modus operandi among other standard universities around.I think many people exaggerate things that attempt to put universities, especially public, in a bad light in Nigeria. Well, my experience so far takes a diverted outlook to that. People say lecturers are sadist, heavens how spurious can that be? About all the several lecturers that have taken me are so comely and approachable. They are ever ready to be useful. I'm talking lecturers and consultants and at least PhD holders. Enter their office anytime. Flag them down when they're on transit ... The major thing I notice that may be giving off the negative opinions about these people, though, is the fact that they will never compromise for a single person. If the worst is the condition, then it will be for the sake of the whole class, and lightly, as such.. The ones I know treat students usually as much as the students right stretches. In addition, the other day say Unilag hiked up its school, everyone castigated the universities, yet the fees are not appreciably inflated here and lots of other schools. In fact, it remains essentially the same.Make una dey calm down with all these shaming and negative vibes na. At least, let there always be a basis, one significant enough before throwing the being or value of a person/institution/organization/establishment down the drain na. Many slanderous or libelous rot, once initiated, will take longer than due to rebuild appropriately.",neutral

"“I am not blaming the lawyers; that is the last thing I would do, but I am sorry to say that the lawyers, with due respect to them, should have done a better job in this regard.Sir, blame them. It's their job and they fell short of giving excellent service to their clients. I guess the Supreme Court Judges knew their clients legal fees would keep mounting if the case drags longer so used their wisdom to stop those lawyers from further billing Mr Obi and Alhaji Atiku by not spending more than 3 working days on the appeal. It was no brainer that the SC rescued Mr Obi and Alhaji Atiku.The mediocrity of the legal representation  of both petitioners stinks to high heavens and gives an idea of how mediocrity would have been the order of the day if these petitioners could assemble this kind of mediocre legal team. Haba!In one fell swoop they sank from being sore losers to mediocre sore losers. That of Alhaji Atiku shocked me more because I believe that someone who had wasted millions in USD for the failed CSU case can hire and pay the services of quality legal team unlike Mr Obi who no dey give shishi and can go for pro bono or cheap legal service providers.I was the first to state here that, after I read the judgement of the brilliantly meticulous Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, I knew it's a death knell to the petition and I do not think that the Supreme Court will spend more than 3 working days to throw out the appeal of both Mr Obi and Alhaji Atiku. Here, a very Senior Legal practitioner is confirming what everyone saw. It was the lowest I have ever seen of a Presidential petition.

But NO! You're an idiot who's fortunate enough to have a human face and penis, so how you eventually believe such a dirty behaviour adds to your ""Masculine Conquests"", is the only thing that still reminds us that you were initially created to be a goat!To think our ancestors proved manhood by conquering lands and protecting their women, while we're here today exposing ours to opprobrium.

"Microsecondnews Reporter 5 mins readFriends defend Nigerian lady who ‘divorced’ her husband at Airport in London upon arrivalThe dramatic case of a Nigerian man, Henry Osah, who arrived in the United Kingdom with his kids to reunite with his wife but was dumped at the airport by the wife who only took the kids with her is continuing to generate reactions.Even as the lady in question has spoken up to defend her actions, a number of her friends are also speaking up in her defence. At least one of the friends, Peace Obule, felt so strongly about the case that he prayed that the man would be deported back to Nigeria, adding that even then it would not be enough for what he did to his wife when she was with him in Nigeria.The story was broken on an online community for Nigerians in the UK by a lady with the Twitter handle @jayydubby.She wrote:“Hello everyone,A family friend of mine is in urgent need of a job with sponsorship. Last month, he arrived in the UK with his children as dependents and his wife went to pick them up at the airport and asked to see their children’s passports, which he handed over without any suspicion. She then told him that their marriage was over and wanted nothing to do with him. She took their children and abandoned him at the airport. He just come to the UK for the first time to join his wife, who came last year to study. He helped pay her fees and sold off everything he had to join her.Today, the Home Office sent him a letter saying that he has until 1st of January, to return to Nigeria. He has nothing to go back to and may never see his children again.I am pleading with anyone who can help him with a job referral so that he can stay and fight for his children. If you know of any job openings or can put him in touch with someone who might be able to help, please reach out to me. I would be incredibly grateful. 🙏🏼😥.”Letter from the Home Office to the estranged husband. He must leave by January next year unless he finds a job.Many netizens reacted to the post with cynicism, insisting that the marriage must have broken down before now for a woman to take that action.JayDubby responded:“For those saying it’s unbelievable, these are some of their chats before he travelled. They never quarrelled. She feigned happiness and was even asking which soup he would like to eat.A Twitter user with the handle @tiffanyibeh responded with some venom, accusing JayDubby of not telling the whole truth.She wrote: “A family friend of yours ?? And you want to say you Donno how he beats up his wife back in Nigeria?? He’s been beating her up for years!! And coming to the UK was her chance of getting freedom! She did what she did just to be with her kids again!”When JayyDubby tried to rubbish her version of events, @tiffanyibeh responded:“Do u want to see evidence of bruises? Do you want to listen to some recordings?? Long before he came those evidences got to the police already! Are you also aware he tried to hurt her at the airport again too  My dear you are no family friend if u donno this story.”@Jayydubby again wrote:  “Lol. So that idea of her going to the airport in clutches was because of this?”@tiffanyibeh: “She broke her leg! Evidence dey!!! No dey cap!!!”@tiffanyibeh: “If you say you are a family friend and you don’t know this story then you are a liar! If you are not married yet may you marry a man like him.Everyone is very much aware of how he hits his wife, down to his siblings and parents and they keep saying he’d change for years now! My dear you’d do exactly what she did if you were in her shoes.Another friend @peaceobule also spoke up. He wrote:“This Family friend named Henry Osah is a  serial wife-beater and a manipulative husband. I’m deliberately not getting involved with this but if I’m pushed I will share receipts of his wickedness. Your family friend deserves everything that came to him. I hope he is deported to Nigeria.How can Henry Osah use the kids as a bargaining chip with his wife. She struggled to go to the UK and since then you have held her to ransom. You deprived her access to the kids because you said if she doesn’t also help you to the UK, she wouldn’t see her kids.The matter long. https://microsecondnews.com/index.php/2023/11/04/friends-defend-nigerian-lady-who-divorced-her-husband-at-airport-in-london-upon-arrival/",negative

When it was served, she gave one turkey to her son of about 6years, one to the daughter of say 3-4yrs and the other one for herself.  While they were feasting on the turkey and drinks, the house help sat on another table starring hungrily and helplessly. Every time the madam turns towards her, the house help will quickly look  away to avoid eye contact with madam.That lady even ate the little piece left by her daughter, paid the bills and left..I know that she might not be the only person guilty of this despicable act, so let's have your comments and opinions on the matter so others like her will learn and probably change....cause to me I feel her action might put the children at great risk of maltreatment and possible harm by the househelp.The thing still dey pain me sha 😡😡😡",negative

"A certified true copy of a document said to be a Police Investigation Report and Legal Advice on the case, marked CR:3000/X/FHQ/ABJ/ADMIN/PPRO/VOL.273/82, but which could not be independently verified by The PUNCH, was obtained from Ibile by our correspondent.The document states the case as “Case of criminal conspiracy, threat to life, attempt to assassinate, forcible entry, malicious damage, land grabbing, criminal trespass, and conduct likely to cause breach of peace.”Speaking on the viral video and the presence of some police officers at the scene, Ibile alleged that Oluwo led some hoodlums to one of his properties and started shooting sporadically. He said he was with his personal security detail comprising some mobile policemen, adding that a team of policemen also came from Abuja following his petition to the Force Headquarters.“The team from Abuja was around. We didn’t even know because the team didn’t have a direct conversation with me. They came to arrest them (Oluwo and others) and these boys were running towards where we were, where my construction staff were working at the back of the estate.“Luckily, we were outside and heard the sound of gunfire exchange between the operatives that came from Abuja and Oluwo and his boys.“Somebody just called me that Esho Olobo (Oluwo) was part of those land grabbers (being chased by the police). I had to join the police myself to launch a manhunt for Esho Olobo and he was arrested,” Ibile said.He added that five of the boys were also arrested and stripped naked by the police. He said when they came out of the bush where the arrests were made, he faced Oluwo and said he (Oluwo) should also be stripped naked.Efforts to reach Oluwo were unsuccessful as calls to his telephone for two straight days were not answered and he had yet to reply to a text message sent to him as of press time.Meanwhile, a group of public interest lawyers, Lawyers for Reform Group, who is demanding justice for Oluwo, raised concerns in a video over the recent activities of land grabbers in the state.Speaking on behalf of the group, the Executive Project Director, LRG, Oladotun Hassan, narrated that a victim of attempted murder (Oluwo) was converted to a suspect by the Nigeria Police Force.“We, the Lawyers for Reform Group, a group of public interest lawyers committed to ensuring the protection of fundamental rights and equitable justice, readily offer to rescue Mr Shamsudeen Oluwo and Mrs Igbinoba Adeyinka who are victims of an attempted murder case but rearrested and converted in a separate matter whereby Oluwo was converted as a suspect in a matter he is the actual victim alongside his coworkers who we all see as victims and on whose behalf and instruction we call on the Inspector-General of Police to match his words with immediate action for onward sanitisation and reform of the Nigeria Police Force so as to pull out all bad eggs,” Hassan said.In a telephone conversation with The PUNCH, Hassan said he had written a petition on behalf of Oluwo and others to the IG on the matter.",negative

"Good.We now have 5 Nigerians working in the Biden govt now.The Nigerians on Biden’s Governance TeamLatest |2 years agoVanessa Obioha writes that today’s inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th President of America is seen by many Africans as a redemption of the fraught relationship the continent had with President Donald TrumpThe long-awaited dream of many Americans to see the 45th president of the United States of America, Donald Trump leave the White House will finally be a reality today as Joe Biden, the winner of the 2020 presidential election will be inaugurated. The ceremony, usually done with fanfare, is on a low key as the nation continues to battle with Coronavirus. The pandemic has claimed nearly 400,000 lives in the United States.On the eve of his inauguration ceremony, the lost souls were immortalised by Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris alongside their families at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. The Pool was illuminated by 400 lights. Each light is meant to represent approximately 1,000 Americans who will have perished from the virus at the time of his swearing-in.Biden is expected to be sworn in by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. on the Capitol’s West Front sometime before noon. This will be followed by an official escort of the President and Vice-President and their families to the White House with representatives from every branch of the military for one city block. It replaces the traditional parade before cheering spectators along Pennsylvania Avenue.Biden’s emergence as the new President of America has long been seen by Africans as a redemption of the fraught relationship the continent had with Trump. Trump’s anti-immigration policies and interference in the nomination of Nigerian personalities to key positions on the global stage, notably Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala’s appointment at the World Trade Organisation did not make him a favourite. However, some Christians will lay their lives down for him as he is believed to be a good Christian, despite his blatant and numerous atrocities.Already, President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed confidence that Biden will restore faith in the country in his congratulatory message to the new President last November.He said, “President-Elect Biden’s remarkable track record gives us hope that he will add value to the presidency and world affairs. We look forward to greater cooperation between Nigeria and the United States, especially at economic, diplomatic, political and security levels,” he said urging “Mr Biden to deploy his vast experience in tackling the negative consequences of nationalist politics on world affairs—which have created divisions and uncertainties—and to introduce greater engagement with Africa on the basis of reciprocal respect and shared interests.”As Biden is officially installed in the White House, all eyes will also focus on the Nigerians that will be working with him. They include Adewale Adeyemi who will serve as the Deputy Secretary of the US Treasury, Osaremen Okolo, as COVID-19 Policy Advisor and Funmi Olorunnipa-Badejo as a White House Counsel.Adeyemi, fondly called Wally was appointed on November 30, 2020, becoming the first African-American to occupy the position. He will work with Janet Yellen who is appointed Secretary of the Treasury. The Osun state born Nigerian was appointed by John Kerry’s presidential campaign at 23 to inspire African-American voters in California. He also participated in the presidential campaigns of John Edwards and Barack Obama. In 2015, he was appointed advisor to the presidency on international economic issues. In 2019, Wally was appointed President of the Obama Foundation that supports charitable work in Africa and elsewhere.Twenty-six-year-old Okolo was named among the 100 people that will work in the White House. She will be part of the new president’s COVID-19 Response Team that will work to quickly implement a comprehensive, whole-of-government COVID-19 response strategy to contain the pandemic, restore public trust, and protect all Americans. The Edo State indigene worked on the Biden-Harris Transition team before her latest appointment. The effort to reverse the blows dealt on America and the world by the pandemic is a major area that the Boden campaign and by which his performance in office will be judged.The Harvard graduate of Medicine and African-American Studies was a Senior Health Policy Advisor in the US House of Representatives. Her work experience includes serving as Legislative Aide for both Health Policy on U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labour, and Pensions (HELP) for Ranking Member Patty Murray of Washington; and U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois.Badejo on the other hand is a lawyer and an alumnus of Berkeley Law College in the US. She has served as a counsel for policy to the Assistant Attorney-General in the Civil Division of the US Department of Justice and Ethics Counsel at the White House Counsel’s Office. She was also Attorney Advisor at the Administrative Conference of the United States during the Obama-Biden administration.These three Nigerians, young and brilliant are expected to help President Biden achieve his set goals while putting the spotlight on Nigeria that is notorious for her lacklustre interest in developing young talents.",negative

"One thing I've learnt from Mohbad death is to remain selfish like Burna Boy.Nigerians can easily turn on you anytime. Na fake love dey everywhere.Everyone reacting like this to Naira Marley without hearing his side of thr story. He wasn't even in the country when Mohbad died. He doesn't even stay in Nigeria. The only thing Nigerians saw was old clips of mohbad calling Naira Marley that he is after him. Mohbad even called out his girlfriend that she wants to kill him and accused her of cheating. Nobody hold the girlfriend o.I'm not a marlain or whatever sh*t they call themselves but let's drop sentiments here. Naira Marley doesn't deserve the current hate. This is Social Media Jungle Justice. People can't just wait to see him dead or incarcerated for life. And they want this done without any investigation.That's why I like Burna Boy. He doesn't give a damn about his Nigerian fans. He's never in the country. He focuses on his international fans. He will never repost anyone and they don't expect such from him. The guy is so arrogant to His Nigerian fans and I think that's what they deserve. He no even send Mohbad or show sympathy, instead e released a song and people dey stream. Lols.Don Jazzy that shows a lot of support to Nigerians and upcoming entertainers. You need to see the way thousands of people where talking trash about him on Imstablog and Gistlover Instagram pages for not reposting Mohbad on his Instagram but only Twitter.

Period you don't have to believe me... They rarely forget something there.And I think that's the reason your lawyer is telling you to sell.For anyone who own a house it can happen but here's what I did do when I brought my houses.Whether for students or families.I drill them like say na DSS office dem come asking questions for like 2 days before I decide to give them the house.I make sure I know your source of income and if you're a student I speak with the parents.Assuring them that if your son misbehave you'll get a call from me ASAP.This keep the students at bay however some after school join gangs.I simply call the parents to tell their kids to find another house.I also outsource this task to a police officer I know that does not collect bribe them dey all division find them.,negative

So he always plays with the kids and bought them goodies a few times. I didn't know I was his target. He later asked me out but deep down I suspected he was a married guy. Long story short.

That I look like and Indian girl that's why he likes and wants to keep me for himself. I just laughed within me. This one thought I was a small girl. So I planned to eat his money and dump him.He invited me out with his friends to go and chop ugba and okporoko at Army barracks Senior officers mess. Omoh..  you can't enter there if you don't have a pass. In fact we had to stop by at the one senior Ogas office  before going there. That was my first time of eating ugba. He kept ordering for more and more plates and me I was just chewing away until my cheek bones began to hurt lol.. same with drinks but I told him I don't take alcohol and he was so happy and was boasting to his friends that ""this my smally doesn't drink"" and that he's so lucky to have me.

"It's amazing how I was contemplating making this post before a member here requested or should I say started asking me questions in that line and being a very free and open person, I promised I was going to post about it. Well... Let me start from my background and up bringing which also contributed indirectly to my nonregrettable actions that has left me in this wonderful marital status.I grew up in a Catholic christian home where good virtues moral values were instilled in us by engaging us in christian children activities from an early age. The Most social part of my childhood ( apart from school) was around the church then back home with close monitoring.  So there was no room for nonsense even up to our secondary and tertiary level. the monitoring was topnotch. So we didn't really get to do shit like our mates who got exposed early to certain lifestyle,; dating number one. We were overprotected and shaped with these guidelines that a mindset was formed that boy and girl relationship is a taboo ( and it's true). So we knew better than to toll that part. In the long run, after I have come off age, it became very difficult to date. This was at age 21. Whenever I manage to give a man a listening ear and he mentions sex, I'll run without looking back because that was a danger sign we were taught to look out for. So i was always running away from men because of premarital sex. It got to a point, after looking like that's the only way to get a husband and I was already in my mid twenties, a time when a girl should be getting ready to settle down, I said ok, let me see if I can bend the rules a bit for this one. This man was a chronic responsible bachelor. So I felt it could work out since he's ready to settle down. He was in his mid 30s the and never married. We were in the same compound. So I gave in and we started dating. Mind you there was no pressure from both parents to get married. My parents will never pressure you to get a suitor. Being a novice in the game, I never knew men could double date or even knew how to handle one when it happens. So, on this fateful day the randy goat came home with another girl. It was our last born that came and told me some girl came to look for him because everyone in the compound knows us together. I was heartbroken and right there I broke up with him without even finding out who or if what they both have is serious. Though I made him cry cos I started entertaining other boys that have been chyking me and bringing them to the compound but I never had anything with them or knew any of their houses. I was just using the to pepper him. Once they say hi, I'll drag them to the compound and we will sit on top of his car sometimes until he now confided in one of our neighbors who now told me to stop that the man is always crying. E never cry. I showed him two can play that game. He tried coming back but I bulshit him.After that I locked up and never trusted any man. I began to see why my dad was being overprotective. I didn't date again for almost five years and then men were coming but that was when my own shakara increased. I mean responsible well to do men o. That was when men had good jobs from banking, investment and oil companies in ikoyi and vi both staff from five star hotel like Eko hotels and suites, federal palace cos those were the places I worked so I had many suitors and friends but the moment they mention relationship, Ill take off. Part 2It continued like that and I was enjoying my life with peace of mind that I forgot about time or didn't bother about it cos I don't care.When I entered mid thirties, I said let me loosen up a bit but because Ive gotten used and enjoyed single life with peace of mind to that age, I found it difficult to commit again because anytime I tried, I'll start having anxiety. The thought of him cheating on me or even as little as admiring another woman will just make me unsettled and I'll think of aborting mission before it's too late.So I said to give one man a chance, he too brought another girl in my absence. I found out from the sister and that was it. I called it off he begged and begged that the lady was forcing herself on him and sending him money bla bla.. he made a conference call with his family begging, my mind was made up I dumped him and moved on to a Choir boy Ive been admiring who was also trying to talk me into a relationship. I truly loved this guy and I think I was older than him in age . Though he refused to tell me his age but I was able to deduce from his Facebook profile cos he wrote class of 2006 while I finished 1999 but because I don't look my age, we just looked like age mate and we loved each other.I met him when he just finished serving and was squatting. I was out of job then but one thing that made me stick with him was, even though he was not working, he shared whatever little he had with me. We were together when a very rich young pastor came asking for my hands in marriage. I told him about it and he started feeling sad that because he doesn't have a bearing now some guy wants to take me away from him. I on the other hand don't really fancy the pastor but wanted to force myself and see if it will work but it wasn't working because I didn't have feelings for him. To now make matters worse, he started showing stinginess. In the three months we courted, we didn't get to sit together because he's a pastor so we only see in church, stand and talk very briefly and disperse and each time he kept posting me about money I asked for to enable me travel for Xmas and the day was fast approaching. It was my Choir boyfriend that wen to borrow money from one girl selling recharge card to give me to travel. Now coupled with the fact that I don't even like him, i just texted him to look for another sister. The highest he ever bought me was two two hundred naira recharge card a stinkingly rich ajebota pastor for that matter ( 2014) but he would always call me.Lastly, in 2016, my bobo got a job in Chevron with a nice apartment in lekki. Before then we had a small quarrel and we're not in talking terms because I requested for money for hair to attend my twins introduction and he told me no money but he didn't tell me he was saving for an apartment. Even then, how much? So, after months of not talking, he called and invited me over to see his new place. A surprise I guess. I got there and we had a nice time. He tried to make it up to me. He gave me his short and polo to wear that day and took me to a pepper soup joint. **Smiling**later we got back and ad I was about to shower, I saw a used shower cap in his bathroom. He now handed me a new one from his wardrobe where there were many more. I asked him who used the one in the bathroom, he said baby don't start again. I held my peace.The following morning he did something that I can't say for sure what really happened.I slept over because there was no way I could go back from lekki to the mainland that day. That night he came to disturb me and I told him you know we can't be doing this. Please let wait till everything is formalized. When he wouldn't let me be, I left him and went to sleep on the floor. In the morning he woke up and was saying you, you, I was just looking at you as we were talking someone knocked on the door. It was a ladies voice. My ex went to meet her and they were together for almost 30mins before he came back inside. Me i didn't talk. I suspected he went to do nonsense because his thing was up when he left only to come back and it has come down.We prepared and left together that morning for work. When I got home, I called and told him off. Na small thing dey vex me. He didn't believe it. So many things on my mind that made me take that huge decision. Men are not worth my type.Since then till date, I stopped anything relationship especially if it's not a born again and I must like him. I faced my God ever since and decided to give myself peace. I can't stand a cheating partner. Disease dey town and I don't want to end up a baby mama.Now, with the way things are, no jobs, the few decent men can hardly fend for themselves let alone catering for a family, I just decided to let sleeping dogs lie. Make person no come enter from fry pan to fire. Some family men now are dumping their family and running away from their responsibilities leaving the women to carry all the burden. So tell me what will make marriage enticing to me again? Abi na domestic violence? Biko Biko.",negative

"Back in the early 90s in Surulere, I would come back from school around 2pm rest for only 30min (basically just eat lunch) and then go to our teachers house for lessons from 4-6pm every day .Long vacation is worse, we would go to lessons from 9am -1pm . In the morning that I would want to watch morning cartoons on local stations because there was no DStv then, DStv came into Nigeria in 1996 and the whole of my street only one person could afford it, and it's usually 419 people. It was ridiculously expensive then, and the dish could cover the front of a whole house sef. (Sarcasm) After all that stress person still dey find job. Lost the one that I had in 2016 immediately APC started implementing killer economic policies that crippled Nigeria into recession .To young parents out there, stop over stressing your children. Cut down TV time and buy them test books and drawing books they would enjoy reading without being forced to. And reduce the spanking, I've noticed that when we were flogged and being scolded too much when we were younger we grow old and not have confidence to express ourselves. Because some of us were not allowed to go outside to play. Take a dog as an example, when you buy a puppy and you show it lots of love and caring, when it grow older it will be so confident and not be too afraid of anything. Unlike when you flog a puppy too much because you think you're training it well, the puppy would grow older and start being too afraid of anything.I know to be a parent is not easy but don't make it look like a military training camp.The first 12 years of your child (creche - JSS 2 is the most important time of their educational foundation, if you mess that time up then you have to get ready to help him or her wiggle through secondary school and then University.",negative

The Kogi state governor cutting up a road that was built with tax payers money into two to prevent electoral materials from getting to a political opponent's stronghold. This muffuug actually sent an an excavator to excavate a highway! 2. The Imo state governor booking all the hotel rooms in Owerri with money from state coffers ahead of the governorship elections next week and leaving people who genuinely need (and who have also paid o) hotel accommodation stranded. and one more honrable mention...3. Zamfara state governor - Meningitis outbreak is a direct punishment from God for the sin of fornication",negative
Now it's too late to even remove fuel subsidies. Anybody who advises Tinubu to remove subsidies and hike the dollar rate at the same time is an evil adviser.

Meanwhile, I look forward to seeing how he fares in next election as APC candidate.Source: Chidi Odinkalu (Twitter)N135bn debt: Court strikes out AMCON’s case against Ifeanyi UbahThe criminal charge filed by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) against Ifeanyi Ubah and his company, Capital Oil and Gas Limited, has been dismissed by the federal high court sitting in Lagos.At the hearing on Wednesday, Channels TV said Oluwaseun Onabowu, counsel to AMCON, gave an oral application to withdraw the suit.Ubah, the senator representing Anambra south, and Capital Oil were hit with a lawsuit for alleged false claims and a debt of N135 billion.The federal government had in 2019, filed charges against Ubah and Capital Oil, leading to the court, on June 13, 2023, directing criminal summons be issued to the senator and his company.The order was given on an 8-count charge bordering on his alleged indebtedness to AMCON.According to the debt-recovery agency, Ubah and Capital Oil allegedly conspired to make false claims in relation to the actual values of certain assets transferred to AMCON under a consent judgment he and his company made with AMCON.The defendants were also alleged to have obstructed AMCON in the realisation of part of his outstanding debt of N135 billion by frustrating the sale of a property at Banana Island, Lagos.Speaking at the proceedings, Onabowu said the parties had agreed to withdraw the case against the senator in Lagos after a consent judgment was reached in a sister case before the federal capital territory (FCT) court in Abuja.The court was urged by the AMCON counsel to strike out the charge filed against the defendants.Affirming the position of AMCON, Ifeoma Esom, the lawyer to Ubah and Capital Oil, confirmed to the court that agreements have been reached with the complainant.Subsequently, Nicholas Oweibo, the presiding judge, struck out the charge.https://www.thecable.ng/n135bn-debt-court-strikes-out-amcons-case-against-ifeanyi-ubah/amp",negative

California right.The average and lowest price of buying a house in california is $850,000. The average salary in california is $5,000 per month. Let's do the calculations.

Infact people can use less than 15m to build an Average low wage home in Nigeria. The average salary in Nigeria is 85,000 naira. I.e it will take the average Nigerian 13years of saving all his monthly wage to buy a house.So bcus my 15m naira here in Nigeria is $15,000 in california does not mean I can't build a decent house for my self here with that....Why should I convert what I earn monthly in Nigeria to Amy foreign country currency while I live in Nigeria and spend naira.

That company has over 1000 nigerians who were safely in the hands of a fortune 500 company, and they have now entered into a one change situation with a wicked unrated nigerian company like OANDO, Mass sack and massive reduction of salary of the remnants looming for them. The Irony is that majority of employees in that company were yorubas.Tinubu also forced the NNPC to sell the PH refinery to thesame OANDO, There is no limitations to the mans greed.WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE from our supposed sophisticated and overly Educated Brothers, their tribesman is burning down the country. I thought these people claimed to be for 1 nigeria. The man has only been appointing his tribesman into government positions. They used to warn us that we should not trust igbo people because their agenda is to hire only their people, they used statistics from the 1950s as proof and in this modern day nigeria these people are doing worse. Without any outrage from their tribe.They will tell you that buhari was also ethnocentric, but one can easily argue that the hausa fulani people are in 3 geopolitical zones in the country making them a more obvious majority when skimming through political positions, what will the yorubas a single geopolitical zone the size of Niger state use as excuse for the extreme bigotry being showed by their tribesman??

"The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja has affirmed the tribunal sacking of Hon. Beni Butmak Lar representing Langtang North/Langtang South Federal Constituency. In turn, the Appellate Court upheld APC's Vincent Venman Bulus as duly elected and returned.The INEC on 27th February, declared Butmak of the PDP winner with 42008 votes against APC's Bulus of the APC who scored 21345 votes.Dissatisfied Bulus & the APC approached the tribunal seeking the disqualification of Lar following the alleged disobedience of the PDP with respect to the Jos High Court order.The Justice Muhammad Tukur-led panel upheld the arguments of the Petitioners, sacked Lar (a fifth-term lawmaker) and affirmed Bulus as winner.Obviously aggrieved and hoping for the reversal of the decision, Butmak & the PDP headed to the higher and final Court in these matters.In consolidated appeals; Suit Nos: CA/J/EP/PL/HR/25/23, CA/J/EP/PL/HR/26/23 & CA/J/EP/PL/HR/37/23, the Appeal Court affirmed Bulus as winner and ordered INEC to withdraw the Certificate of Return issued to Lar and issue same to Bulus.The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja has also affirmed the tribunal decision sacking Peter Ibrahim Gyendeng of the PDP. The Court affirmed Labour Party's Fom Dalyop Chollom as Reps member representing Barkin-Ladi/Riyom Federal Constituency.Fom Chollom challenged the declaration of Gyendeng as winner of the 25th February polls.Fom's petition was hinged on the ground that Gyendeng  was not validly nominated by his party claiming that PDP had no valid structure in the state at the time of his nomination as a candidate.The tribunal unanimously agreed with the petitioner and sacked the PDP Candidate. The three-man panel further ordered INEC to withdraw the Certificate of Return issued to Gyendeng and issue same to Chollom.However, the PDP Candidate went on appeal.In consolidated appeals, Suit Nos: CA/J/EP/PL/HR/47/23 & CA/J/EP/PL/HR/23/23, the Court upheld the tribunal decision. The three-man appellate Justices held that the PDP had the opportunity to obey the Court order but chose not to. They held that the PDP had no valid structure.They ordered INEC to withdraw the Certificate of Return issued to Gyendeng and issue same to Fom as duly returned winner.The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja earlier upheld the electoral victory of Kawu Abdulrahman Sumaila (NNPP) representing Kano South Senatorial District.Kawu, a 3-term member of the House of Reps, a former Deputy Minority Leader in the 6th & 7th Assembly (ANPP), an ex-aide to former President Muhammadu Buhari on National Assembly matters, ex-member of the merger Committee, NEC and National Caucus of the APC was declared winner in February having scored 319557 votes  against ex-Gov Kabiru Ibrahim Gaya (APC) who had been in the Senate since 2007 scoring 192518 votes.Gaya approached the tribunal who on September 11, unanimously dismissed the petition with a N200000 fine in favour of Kawu.The Court of Appeal also upheld the tribunal decision affirming Erhiatake Ibori-Suenu as Reps member representing Ethiope Federal Constituency.APGA's Ogboru Michael Etabunor had unsuccessfully challenged the victory of the PDP Candidate at the tribunal. The Appeal Court today dismissed the petition as lacking in merit and affirmed Erhiatake, daughter of former Governor James Onanefe Ibori as duly elected and returned.The Court of Appeal sitting in Lagos also upturned the tribunal decision sacking Labour Party's Ibe Okwara Osonwa as Reps member representing Arochukwu/Ohafia Federal Constituency.In February, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, declared LP's Osunwa winner with 8946 votes, defeating closest challengers: APC's Daniel Chimezie Okeke, APGA's Okuji Obinna Oreh and PDP's Ifeanyi Uchendu scoring 6635, 5211 and 2763 votes respectively.In a petition brought by the PDP, APC and their respect Candidates, the Justice Adeyinka Aderibigbe-led three-man panel sacked Osonwa for non-compliance with the Electoral Act 2022.The tribunal further affirmed the APC Candidate, Okeke as duly elected and returned.Aggrieved by that decision, Osonwa appealed the judgement praying the final Court in these matters reverse the decision of the tribunal.The Appeal Court granted the appeal, set aside the tribunal's decision and unanimously re-affirmed Osonwa as duly elected and returned.",negative

"All these lamentations by Atiku are unnecessary. In election petitions Atiku will traditionally bring up counter arguments focused on the voting pattern and counts.  He did not do that this time.  He was easily swindled by David Hundeyin who led social media into believing, first, that Tinubu did not attend CSU, and later added that the Tinubu that attended CSU is female, and not same as the male Tinubu who is President. Atiku failed to put the electorate in perspective of the court case.  He came second with over 6M votes.  That many millions of voters did not vote Atiku because they believed he went to school and graduated, and his certificate was not forged.  Neither did 8million voted Tinubu on account of his academic background or status.  These were pure outcome of partisan politics and situational judgement of past experience, accomplishments and trust in who they believed had capacity....certificate or not, forgery or not....with skills and competence to right the wrongs of society and lead Nigeria.  Atiku left the electorate pattern and followed Hundeyin's scam.  I do not empathise with his loss.  ...and no, there is no consequence to be suffered by Nigerians because Atiku lost at Supreme Court.  He needs to quit.  Retire from chasing Presidency.",negative

"GNLD.. The GOAT of Scam InterviewsI saw their vacancy advert and applied. Got their message inviting me for an interview due to my impressive CV. I'm just fresh into the Labour market and my grades were not on the CV but WTH.. They said impressive, so nothing else mattered. I was in cloud 8 😌So I approached Henry, who joyfully lent me the same suit he gave me during my project defence. Henry is broader at the shoulders so the suit was supposed to be bigger at the shoulders. However, I think the impressive praise I got expanded my shoulders to angle 90 to fit the suit so I no wan hear say e no match.😑I spent about 90% of my muscle mass and the energy from the food I ate that day ironing razor sharp gators into the suit trousers. Hopefully, they will clear the path for me 😎. That's how son of man prepared o, thinking my breakthrough was finally here. The LUDE polish saw depreciation that night as I generously applied it to the brogues to hide the age of the shoes. They always said then that how you dressed is how you want to be addressed.5 A.M., and I was on the way to Yaba, to meet up with this high profile, Fortune 500 Company with a Potential to Empower The Youths of Tomorrow, as per their description in the SMS. I navigated the alleys with a chip on my shoulder (bro, I'm wearing suit and brogues, what do you expect?), and finally arrived at the venue. 😌The venue? I remember thinking. This is just like an empty space with all these benches in football centre and tarpaulin demarcation here and there. Even the people there, the way they were dressed, I kuku concluded that if this was the place, we are not here for the same thing. After all, one brilliant man said 'Don't judge a book by its covers' (Ogun later kee this man sha).🔥I sha brought out my BIRD flip phone and dialled my boss (who later introduced himself as Line Manager, which is a term I found impressive (for about 2 hours)). This man came out, but he didn't dress like CEO with his SAMSUNG blue light phone (those business centre model) 😐. On the other side, Mark Zuckerberg sef dey wear one Kain shirt with trouser so make I chill. He said I should go with him and I did. That's how we passed different groups of people o, until we reached where this man kept his own army of recruits. I was given a seat and I nodded to all those other guys (some of whom dressed to kill too.). Okay, let's do this.😎That's how this man began to talk long story o. From history of Golden Neolife Diamite and all those things, to how leg and leg will multiply to give more legs, to selling health products to buying starter pack.. Omo. Is this interview or training for the interview. At a point, I had to ask o and he started another story that described how 'Salary is slavery-something-something..'. Imagine telling me that came to chop your money with my impressive CV that what you are supposed to pay me is slavery.. In that case, enslave me abeg, that's what I'm here for. I didn't come for freedom nah 🥲When I saw that ontop the heat dealing with me inside this borrowed suit, Oga was not ready to enslave anybody, instead, wanted to chook hand inside our pocket, I excused myself and left to take a serious decision. I had a serious decision to make between concocting a story on how the interview I dressed to kill for went or how God will punish GNLD. I later settled for the latter and told whoever cared to listen that once they see people sitting down in clutches in any interview center, they should leave immediately and send 'God Punish You' to the person that reached out to them. 🤬Now that I think of it, God will still punish them 🤬",negative

"Twins Video Leak: You Are Childish, Samklef Hits Back At DavidoNigerian music producer and artiste, Samklef, has publicly berated afrobeats superstar, Davido, whom he accused of blocking him on social media over leaking the now viral video of his newborn twins.LEADERSHIP had earlier reported that a video showing Davido, his wife and the newborn twins leaving a United States hospital circulated online on Friday.Davido slammed Samklef for allegedly sharing the video public on Instagram, describing the music executive as a “clouth chaser” among other uncomplimentary words.Although Samklef, who clarified that he saw the video on X (formerly known as Twitter) and posted same, later told fans that he and “Davido are kool”. However, hours later, he made a video expressing displeasure for what he called “disrespect” from Davido.A visibly angry Samklef said: “I have never posted anything negative about you Davido, but today Davido, you allowed your emotion, you came to my timeline to disrespect me.“First and foremost, me and you no be mates, you met me in this industry, we are not mates. If you are Davido, you are Davido for yourself. We are celebrating for your good news. Say you want to dey intimate me ni? O wa si timeline mi, o so fun mi pe ‘I am wicked, I am clouth chaser’. Then, what are you? You we dey call person, are you not a clouth chaser? What have you been doing all your life? You think say I dey fear you? I dey give you respect but you no respect yourself. This na good news, we supposed dey dey celebrate you.“I sent you a message, I believe that as a wise guy, you supposed to understand. First and foremost, who recorded that video? Secondly, the person that recorded and leaked that video is from your circle. Why you no go blame other people? Why did you choose me? Oh, is it because your other guy did not post it first, I posted it first? Is that why you were attacking me? I want you to tell me.“Because for the fact that you blocked me, it shows that you are pathetic and you are childish. I don’t belong to anybody, I no dey fear anybody.

"Lol. I personally have lost interest in that App that even most times now, I forget I have the App on my Phone. The only feature that mostly takes me there sometimes now is The Marketplace whenever i have things to sell urgently or buy at cheaper rate.... Reason I lost interest is cos I realized long ago that a lot of people in there post all sorts of irrelevant nonsense in their feeds and I get irritated by that. I see most people in there as not really matured mentally, just physically. Making all sorts of posts that don't make any sense, plus revealing too much about themselves and families too. I also feel like there are some people In there who act like monitoring Spirits watching one's progress based on what he posts and does in there. Hence, I stopped posting much about myself, can't even remember the last post I made in there. I've decided to be posting stuffs there now when I feel it's just important I do. I can't be feeding people updates about what goes on in my life and family's anyhow. My favorite Apps now are Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. In that exact order.I love Twitter just because of the Trending topics where I get to know what's going on for the day and I get updated.Instagram also to check some News, comedy posts and skits (I follow a lot of Naija Blogs and Instagram commedians), football updates etc. Almost like Twitter.

"You know all those stories you read online and you say, ‘eiyahh, stories that touch.” Hmm, my sister, that is my story, o!This man, yes, I will refer to him as this man. When I met him years back, I was already working and driving a small car, you know those Picantos that flooded Lagos in those days? Yes, I was one of those who owned one. I was lucky to have landed a good job but aside from that, na sharp Ibo babe I be na, I know how to do market well.I started a shuttle bus business on the side; for a church. I got my younger brother to run it for me. After about two years, we got another one; at this time, my husband and I had begun to court, he was doing business in Dubai then.Then Dubai was a very hot destination for Nigerians and I honestly thought his business was doing good.What was he doing? Buying and selling na? What else? All kinds of stuff; computer parts, female wears…stuff, sha!Ok, when the matter got to the point of Marriage, he went to know my people in the village. They met with his, you know the rest how these things are, we had our Igba kwu and church. A few years later the kids began to come, we have five children!Along the line, his business just began to crumble and this happens when you are fraudulent; you cannot sustain good business on fraud, you just can’t!To be honest, I began to suspect he wasn’t doing genuine business shortly after we got married. He was dodgy about certain things, certain monies coming in, you know, I would ask him for certain papers and he was quite dodgy about them. I decided to mind my own business, after all he had been doing his thing before we met, so which one be my own?I also knew I had to separate my business from him. I continued to use my maiden name in all my transactions on my own business.Then he ran into customs wahala in Dubai, his goods were seized and that marked the end of things for him. Naturally as his wife, I encouraged him to be positive, I told him he had to get the right papers, organize his business in such a way that he would not raise red flags every time he passes through customs.At that time, my job and businesses were thriving, I had five buses in my fleet, I had two schools and the church as clients; also, I had already bought a land from doing cooperative in my office.Now, that land was bought with the mind that at least, I would be able to give my sons something to inherit. Land is a surer investment; transport business is good but buses always run down, break down, need fixing with you spending money…you get?So, I first got a piece of land which I bought in my maiden name. That one became wahala for oga at home. He hala me tire, we had long quarrels. He wanted me to put his name on the papers for the land, me kwa, I refused, instead I put the name of my first son; we have three boys and two girls.I then purchased a second land, again I used my second son’s name….I was just doing business as per say, e dey my blood and this job may not last. I wanted something to retire to as well; I am not the type of woman who waits for a man to provide everything for her and in a way, yes, I wanted to support my husband’s hustle, if he was unable to provide for us, would I fold my arms but no bi say make I kuku carry the load of provision for my head.But even before the wahala of his business, I was paying school fees, rent, fueling our gen, paying house helps, lesson teacher, driver…Nne, I was Mrs Man in the house o!Things got bad and my husband just became a degenerate!You know, he would faff around and go to the club in the evening and come back at past 3am! Biko which kind wahala be dis?So, I decided to help out, na, isn’t that what a good wife should do?I swear, I regret it to date!What did I do? I asked my brother, who I run the businesses with, I mean the one who manages the fleet of buses and over sees the new business we began, to allow my husband to join him, so at least he would have a sense of responsibility, instead of him parading night clubs like a male prostitute!Abi? As he goes to clubs, no bi my money e dey go spend there?Husband joined my brother and after a few weeks, na so so complain e dey complain; my brother did this, my brother did that, wahala every day… ol Gehl, I had to ask my brother to leave!Because the quarrels were everyday and for my peace of mind, I just begged my brother, biko move to the other things we are doing; I asked him to focus fully on the nylon business we had just begun because all I heard every day was my husband complaining and my brother calling to tell me to tell my husband to back off!Hummn. My sister like I told you, I still had my job and I had five children to raise, so my mind was most times not on the bus business or nylon business.Then under my husband, who claimed he was helping me save cost that my brother was squandering, the buses would develop fault more often than before; yes, during my brother’s time, the buses too had problems, so it wasn’t a new thing for me.The difference was that the cost of maintenance skyrocketed! My husband fired the old drivers and hired new ones then he would bring mechanics and his new drivers to me and they would complain about this and that and ask me to bring huge sums of money. At first, I would just sign the cheques for payment of these parts but after like six months, I began to document the things being repaired.It was just on a hunch; I discovered I was being fleeced by the drivers and mechanics…they were fixing the same things they claimed had been fixed earlier.Na every six months dem dey repair fuel pump? Gear box? Shocks?I vexed, one day, I accused one of them of being a thief and cursed him and told him because of this thing he did to me God would punish him. Do you know what the man told me? He said, ‘Madam, na your husband dey do am, na hin tell us to increase price then he will pocket it!’Nne, I shock but to be sincere, I no too shock because my brother had said the same thing months back.The driver dropped the bus key and stopped working for us.So, I had to call my brother, I told him and he told me some of the drivers had called him to tell him the same thing but that he didn’t want to ruin my marriage so he kept quiet after the first time he told me.Chineke! I said which marriage? Marriage that I had been the one managing since the day we got married. I paid the rents, paid the hospital bills for delivery of all five children, paid the maids, the drivers, bought the land and…and yet he squanders what he gets on ashis at clubs! Abi you think I don’t know that he meets with ashis? Or is he meeting his aunties at the club?Biko shift o!I told my brother, enough is enough!So, I am telling you the same, I no do again… to your tent o Israel!Nigeria Series written and edited by Peju Akande and based on true storieshttps://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/07/chai-my-husband-has-been-doing-me-yahoo-yahoo/",negative

I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one—I in them and you in me— so that they may be brought to complete unity.

Christianity is more than just Roman Catholics and Baptists and Methodists, Presbyterian, 7days Adventists, Anglican, Redeem and maybe a thousand more—there are now over 45,000 denominations, and Christianity is fragmenting at a rate of two new denominations per day.In Mathew 7:7, Jesus said ask and you will be given...But here Jesus asked but was not given! So how to build a Central Church for all?HOW TO BUILD A CENTRAL CHURCH By Bashir Lucas Samson Lukman  Over the years, different Christian denominations have risen making it difficult to know which of these denominations are really following the teachings of Jesus Christ and which are the heretics. Each denomination with one or two differences in contrast to other denominations ranging from the number of books in their Bible, mode and time of worship and who exactly is to be worshipped.It would surprise no one to know that Muslims have a unifying mode of worship, very unique, facing the same direction and reciting from the Quran consisting of the same chapters. I think it is high time Christendom rose to address and solve the problem of disunity among them.The Muslims have a central mosque at local, state, national and international level respectively unlike Christianity. Now, the question is, is it possible to unite all Christian denominations probably by having a central church where different denominations can worship?? It is almost impossible or else the points listed below could be addressed/tackled.I think one of the first step in successfully having a central church is for the Catholic Church to ask the protestant churches to ""BRING BACK OUR BOOKS"". It is obvious that the Catholic Bibles consist of 73 Books while the protestant Bibles consist of 66 books. After the protestants rebelled/revolted against the Catholic churches, they decided that God only inspired 66books.To have a peaceful and organized central church, there should be an agreement on how many books should the Bibles consist of so that there wouldn't be commotion in the central church.Another issue that needs to be addressed to have a peaceful and organized central church is how to resolve the differences between the KJV Bible and the RSV, NIV and NWT Bible. The KJV Bible needs to tell these versions to ""BRING BACK OUR VERSES"". The RSV Bible unceremoniously expunged 16verses from its pages whereas these verses are in the Kjv Bible. If this issue is not addressed, there may be commotion in the central church because if a KJV Bible using pastor ask a RSV using member to open to Matthew 17:21,the member would search till eternity. Some of the verses expunged from the pages of NIV, NWT, RSV includes Matthew18:11,Mark7:16,Mark 9:44, John 5:4,acts 8:37, Romans16:24 etc.Furthermore, the idea of having a central church looks almost impossible judging by the difference in the mode of worship of different Christian denominations. For example, if on a Sunday morning, different Christian denominations gather in the central church to praise and worship God and the service was conducted by a Christ apostolic pastor, if the pastor starts singing and clapping, Jehovah witnesses in the building would be like, WTF!!!, we are not going to clap. They wouldn't shout the way the pastor is shouting and the moment the pastor says Jesus is God, Jehovah witnesses and unitarian Christians in the building would be like, "" Is this pastor is High on something?"". What would be done to the Mormons?? If a pastor from the church of latter day saints happen to be in charge of the service, the non Mormon members would be looking like zombie the moment he starts quoting from book of Moses or book of Nephi. How about that awkward moment when a Celestial pastor is conducting the service and he orders everyone to pull of their shoes forbidding them to wear it in side the church...If they want to worship God and they have English, Chinese, Yoruba, Hausa, Spanish, etc. speaking congregation, what language would they use in worship that's gonna make then United??Having a central church MIGHT be possible, it's just going to be like ""FUJI HOUSE OF COMMOTION""Bashir Lucas Samson Lukman",negative

"Nigeria! Another life wasted by God knows who! Criminals commit heinous crimes and often evade justice because Nigeria is a highly disorganized country. If our leaders really care about the lives, wellbeing and properties of Nigerians, three very important factors should be addressed. 1: The government should ensure there’s a database of all Nigerians through the registration and issuance of national identification numbers, and national identity cards. China has a population of about 1.4 billion yet every citizen has their own unique identification number. When children are born, they feet prints are taken by the police station located with the hospital, and before they’re discharged from the hospital, they fingerprints are collected and used to generate their unique identity numbers. 2: The government should ensure every city, town and village has CCTV functional and efficient monitoring cameras. There’s hardly a spot or alleyway in China that isn’t covered by CCTV cameras in spite of its huge geographical size. 3: The police should be sufficiently equipped to fight crime. They should be paid salaries commensurate with their duties. Na person wey chop bellyful dey pursue thief! These are my humble suggestions.",negative

"So during yersternite's duty, this Lexus ES300 Uber/Bolt driver carrying 3 girls drove to my pump for fuel of #3,000 (5 litres) requesting to pay via card, which the POS machine declined (I think it's Zenith card). On letting him know, he pleaded with me to try again.Normally, I don't try a declined card twice on my pos to avoid 'debit without approval' (a situation where a card is debited but isn't approved by the POS transaction) customer wahala. I do tell them to check another pump if they can't make transfer. But I had pity on him due to the way he was pleading so decided to help out as he wasn't having cash, neither could he do transfer. Due to the rush in my pump, I gave him the POS machine to hold while it's connecting, so I could attend to other customers. Brethren, that was my second biggest regret this month (first one was someone that did transfer of #6,000 to my First bank from opay because Access bank transfer wasn't going throughout that day, up till now, I'm yet to see that one) cos some moments later, this dude legit looked me eyeball to eyeball and told me approved to which I asked again, approved? Which he repeated loud and clear, Yes, approved bro. but it was a big fat lie. It had declined again. My motive of asking was to confirm because I had ran out of paper roll so I couldn't print it out and dude was in a hurry begging me to sale for him first when I insisted to go and get a paper roll, so I didn't bother to verify if it really approved by going back to 'reprint' to check the status of the transaction. I just swallowed his words — hook, line and sinker. It pains me most from the bottom of my heart 💔 because this is money that I was supposed to add and pay my faculty fees — deadline is tomorrow (I was lucky enough to borrow from a colleague) But this dude and several others effortlessly scammed me and put me in huge debt which would be debited from my salary because I decided to trust my fellow county men.I still have the failed transaction receipt, and will keep it well. I will upload the pics when I get home in the morning. Though, I don't think I can recall the guy's face if I should see him again, but then, miracle no dey tire Jesus!!

Same way supporters of Buhari kept downplaying things from the beginning and attributing them to figments of the imaginations of bitter opponents, is the same way Tinubu supporters are playing politics with what's going on in certain South West states right now.Your Muslim(x2) ticket is already emboldening criminals of fulani extractions and they're slowly perpetuating societal ills in Yoruba lands, yet Tinubu's supporters are busy paying lip service and insulting others with pretentious rhetorics. My only worry is the fact that SS borders Yoruba states and this menace is capable of exploding into our region when the chickens begin to roost. Otherwise, na to just sidon watch fulani people run una comot for una ancestral lands like they've done to certain areas of the middle belt. Make una continue dey play politics with everything.

"Nigerians are the number one problems of Nigeria 🇳🇬. God help Nigeria 🙏 Nigerians are the problems of Nigeria.......for real!Greed and Dishonesty,  the two main problems of an average Nigerian.Read along to understand our reasons for saying so......(N.B : If you are a fraudster and criminal on Nairaland, Skip to the next post or you may not survive reading this)*HOME TRUTH*I run a manufacturing business and a trading business.The biggest challenge in my manufacturing business is not power, or infrastructure, the biggest challenge is getting honest staff. Everyone we hire appears to be on a mission to steal as much as possible. Inflated invoices, recording less than the actual number of units produced. The worst part of it all is that all the fraud we've uncovered is not done by a single person, it's usually many staff who collude with each other, from production, to sales, to finance, even top management. There was a year I overhauled management 3 times in a year.........But me, I've found a solution sha, I now use Indian management. So competent, so honest and so straightforward. I thought they were expensive at first with all the visa fees, accommodation, house staff, but now that losses due to staff theft have been reduced to a minimum, and efficiency increased, the Indian management has turned out to be cheaper than the previous Nigerian management. Now, all sensitive positions involving money go to Indians. Nigerians are only allowed in non-sensitive positions. I used to criticize companies like Dangote Group that hire so many Indians when there are many unemployed Nigerians, but now, I understand their decision.My biggest challenge in the trading business is the same, getting honest staff. The form of trading occurs in the open market, and involves staff having access to huge sums of money running into a few millions. I know how much I pay to security companies to provide escorts for the staff, not to prevent robbery, but to ensure that the staff go straight to the bank to deposit the money after the day's sales and not disappear with my money. This money spent on security companies is even enough to be declared as profit. We have to spend on CCTV, biometric scanners and other things that wouldn't be needed if staff weren't looking for the slightest opportunity to steal.It got so bad at a point that my main criteria for employing staff was no longer competency but honesty. At least, competency and skills can be learnt, but once you're dishonest, you're dishonest.We always complain of the economy and how there are no jobs. I know people abroad who would have loved to set up job creating businesses in Nigeria but they can't because they can't get any trustworthy person to run it.I know people in Nigeria with so much money, they want to start factories and other job-creating businesses but they can't because they are occupied elsewhere and can't get any trustworthy person to run the business. So instead of investing in the real sector and creating jobs, they'll just buy treasury bills, while the thieves are shouting no jobs.Many big businesses would have been born in Nigeria if we could engage in partnerships, but we cant because you can't trust anyone. This is one advantage the Indians and Lebanese have over us in Nigeria. They can pull resources together and do mega-business, unlike Nigerians that because only one person must do everything since we can't partner, end up with small, tiny businesses.Start a poultry and they will be stealing your eggs. Some will even go ahead to be killing the chickens so that they'll be allowed to take them home.Start an entertainment/viewing/game center and they'll be pocketing your money. On the days you're around at the business, the money realized will be x10 of the money realized when you're not around..... Because they're eating your money.Lease out a vehicle to a driver to use and watch as he'll finish you.Start a restaurant, the same thing will happen. More than half of the total food ingredients will end up in their personal kitchens.Even ordinary provisions shop, they will find a way to steal.You'll see them with that their evil, wicked saying ""na where person dey work, na there e dey chop, na e make dem dey callam workchop/workshop""...... Just imagine, justifying theft at work.And you'll see these people point their crooked fingers at politicians when they're not any different. I usually say the reason most Nigerians haven't stolen billions of government money, is simply lack of opportunity.*On every level, Nigerians are the problem of Nigeria*.If the truth wanna kill the online fraudsters and criminals we have on Nairaland,you guys should better die now.We will continue to hit your head as much as we can with the truth and be against your fraudulent lifestyle ALWAYS. For all the scams you have scammed innocent people all over the world,  and they end up committing suicide or becoming homeless,  and y'all here thinking you are living large,  kid you not, you will never enjoy that fraudulent money, it will lead you to your grave soonest. (You can keep hating honest,  and  hardworking members on this forum,  but some of us will continue to kill you with the truth.)Only if God doesn't exist.Thieves,  Barawos everywhere. **********************************GREED!!!When we say we are our own problem they start grumbling.....Okay listen to these examples:1. You sell chicken and add over 40% profit ,you are happy forgetting that the person that bought the chicken sells tomatoes and pepper. 2.   The tomatoes and pepper seller has to recover the excess she paid for the chicken, so  she adds her own 42% profit margin.3. Teacher will come and buy these 2 items with what? She has no other alternative than to increase lesson fees or school fees. 4. You will go and rent house from a landlord who has paid excess for cement, sand, chicken, tomatoes and pepper,  lesson fees, how will he meet up if not by increasing his house rent by 60%.And the circle continues, it is not about dollars, dollars is just an excuse, abi wetin concern garri, beans and yam with dollars. The problem is you and I and our excessive greed.Only a fraudster or criminal will be wailing about our above post.We hope you ain't one of them kiddo?If so, we understand your weeping about the honest truth.No wonder you are your fellow children are always wailing and in serious pains reading our posts here.The earlier, the better for you.Advice from the elders  Stormtrooper11:Your right,but we got good ones tooSure we do get the good ones among the youths.heyhey2016:I like your answerOnly sane, honest and hardworking Nairalanders like you will definitely like our answers and comments, Not the miserable fraudsters aka, children of hate,  frustrations and perdition that abound here.God bless your legit hustle man.It will end in praise for you. Addendum:The below are screenshots from a very recent party we went to grill Barbecue for one of our clients we met on Nairaland,And the below are the amount  of meats the food caterer hired for the event stole, ready to take home with her.After telling people at the party that beef has finished!(After being paid close to 2 Million Naira for her catering job!!)A picture speaks more than a thousand words.

"Microsecondnews Reporter November 6, 2023  2 minutes readNigerians berate female content creator for showing her n@ked body to dispatch rider (Video)Photo captions: SwizzyBellaNaija SwizzyBellaNaija opening her towel for the delivery man to see.Some Nigerians are calling for the arrest of a content creator with the name SwizzyBellaNaija, after she uploaded a video of herself showing her n@ked body to a dispatch rider for content.The Abuja-based content creator who is blessed with a huge bosom, said she did the ‘experiment’ to see the reaction of the dispatch rider to her endowment.According to her, she ordered something online and when she sighted the male delivery man coming upstairs to her apartment, she arranged with her photographer to film him.She announced that she would like viewers to see what his reaction would be to a ‘set up’.Once the man was there, she told him she wanted to show him something and he should follow her.When they descended to a landing on the staircase, she asked the man to stand away from her. She then opened her towel for the man.“Why you come dey shake?” she can be heard asking the man.“I’m not shaking anything” the man responded calmly, appearing unfazed.But when the material got online, it did not receive the kind of reception Bella was expecting.Many netizens thought it crossed the line, and was tantamount to s3xual harassment of the gentleman who was only there to do his job.Many argued that if the role were flipped, the women would be shouting about s3xual harassment.Some reactions:@OllikBrown: “This is serious harassment if it was to be the other way round, press and media go don carry am”@Dapor4: “Oh my God!! How is the innocent man feeling right now? This is sexual assault and it should be taken up. The world isn’t safe for men no more!! I can’t shake right now, I’m busy, i will shake later..”@abazwhyllzz: “I’m so páined watching this video. Imagine if that dispatch rider is married what will the wife think about him if she gets to see this video…..This girl needs to be arrested”@Updateboyx: “Imagine It’s a guy with one random girl hawking groundnut. This app for don catch fire…. werey lawon people yi”@d3estiiny: “Men need to start taking actions against women”@abazwhyllzz: “This is pǔrè sèxûal harássment.What men face in the society, Omo innocent dispatch rider. If this was to be the other way round it could have been something else. I hope the authorities involved do something about this please”Following the backlash, the video appears to have been pulled down as it could not be found on the lady’s page when we checked.https://microsecondnews.com/index.php/2023/11/06/nigerians-berate-female-content-creator-for-showing-her-nked-body-to-dispatch-rider-video/",negative

"The thing be say this life no just get formula, na to just find wetin dey work for pezin, make pezin stick to am.Three weeks ago, a guy I know of won 15 millionaire by staking a game of just N300. With 1000, that 15M could've even tripled. At that moment, I really wished I was a gambler. Imagine the turn around that'll follow that. There ade other stories out there too.I think the key in life is just to never go overboard and always playing safe. Otherwise, life no get formula jare. Like if you dey gamble, always use your brain. Only 10% of your net finance. If you're not one, do something else to improve your life, but within limits. Because even careless businesses have ruined wealthy people. With carefulness, no one ever loses. Ire o.Omo, I happy for you o baba mi, be like e dey click for you, e no go spoil for you. Nairaland get plenty more wise people, just pay more attention you go see them. Thank you for the encomium senior man. 🙌 I dey my late 20s.maisauki:Patience, brotherly 🫂Just give that guy two to three years and see whether he's still a millionaire You people are misunderstanding the idea of reality. Life is not black and white. Some things, like carefulness, cautiousness, and discipline, will keep some conditions safe regardless of any storm. With them, you no go too quick rich/win, but you no go ever lose. If that guy that won 15M stick to using 300 daily to stake a game with the hope to win another 15M, do you know it will take him about 137 years before that his current money (15) get exhausted? That's to assume he doesn't win at all through those years o. It's indiscipline and carelessness in handling whatever we have that makes us lose, gambling or not. titusmichael27:I give you a period of three years. In this game, pray not to win because that's the root of all povertyLife's not black and white, that one's a gambler doesn't automatically mean his life will be ultimately miserable. That one's a cleric, so uptight or focused doesn't mean their life will be ultimately successful. Discipline and carefulness are the closest to the formula in life, but life no get one kain formula, baba mi.Peace o",negative

MEMBER REPRESENTING AROCHUKWU/OHAFIA FEDERAL CONSTITUENCYMy attention has just been drawn to a judgment delivered few minutes ago by the National and State House of Assembly Election Tribunal sitting in Umuahia, comprising of Hon. Justice Adeyinka A. Aderibgbe (Chairman), Hon. Justice Kadi Mustaha A. Lalloki (Member I) and Hon. Justice Farouk U. Sarki (Member II).I am reliably informed by my team of lawyers, that the said judgment, in summary, disqualified my candidacy for the election under the platform of the Labour Party and my return as the winner of the said election as declared by INEC, having garnered the majority of lawful votes cast.It will be important to state that at the conclusion of the election in the Arochukwu/Ohafia Federal Constituency, INEC in their declaration returned me as the winner with 8,946 votes, while Okeke Chimezie and APC scored 6, 635 votes.Following my said disqualification, the Tribunal declared Okeke Chimezie of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the winner of the election, and, further Ordered that the Certificate of return issued to me be withdrawn and same issued to the said Okeke Chimezie.The Tribunal, I am informed, hinged their judgment on my disqualification on Sections 77(2) and (3) of the Electoral Act, 2022, an issue which the Appellate Courts have severally posited are not for the Election Tribunal, but remain in the domain of pre – election matters.My candidacy for election under the Labour Party had never been in doubt and was further reinforced by the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia, in a well – considered judgment delivered on 4/12/2022 in Suit No.: FHC/UM/CS/129/2022.Today’s Tribunal judgment is not only perverse in all its ramifications, but also an affront on the established tenets of democracy and the wish and rights of the good people of the Arochukwu/Ohafia Federal Constituency in choosing their representative at the National Assembly.I wish to assure all my constituents of my resolve to Appeal this judgment in my determined bid to recover the mandate freely given to me by a wide majority of the people of my constituency. I urge all my supporters to remain calm and prayerful as this “victory” against us is only phyric, and, will not endure, as the points upon which this perverse judgment is hinged cannot be sustained on the basis of the facts, circumstances of the case and the extant electoral laws.I want to emphasize my belief, trust and confidence in the ability of the Nigerian Judiciary to dispense justice to all manner of men without fear, favour, ill – will or affection.  My impending Appeal will definitely bring succor to our present discomfort as a result of this judgment and reinforce my emergence as your representative at the lower chamber of the National Assembly.DATED THIS 11th DAY OF SEPTEMBER CHIEF IBE OKWARA OSONWA(Hon. Member Representing Arochukwu/Ohafia Federal Constituency)",negative

Only fools celebrate those establishments.More barracks, rise in insecurity.More revenue, rise in cost of living.More exports, more unfavorable balance of payment for Nigeria.Are they honest?Let them stop bribery in the police force. Let them stop harassing unarmed Nigerians. Let them respond swiftly when crime is reported. Let them stop arresting all the people in a village because of a crime that occurred in the village. They arrest those people not to investigate the crime but to extort bail money. Let bail be free indeed. Let police cells be kept neat because money is being budgeted for the maintenance. Instead of establishing the new centers, use the money to improve the miserable lives of the police officers so some of the officers will easily resist the urge to take bribe.",negative

He didn't know I found out and after I left him, he started begging saying please come back, na only you be my size. Huh . So you know? I say no, go and meet those boreholes because they are giving you money, Ewu. He gathered all his family on the phone begging, meanwhile my last ex was already toasting me in the bus on my way to the camp while on the call.  . Na so I cut phone face the new bobo wen I don dey eye for choir since.  If he didn't cheat with that his small p, I probably would have still been with him. .",negative

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKrpFSrH3z0Speaking on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) News, David Hundeyin made it known that in over 30 years, Tinubu managed to get away with all of this baggage hanging around him but this is the first time the right questions are actually being raised and pursued. The news anchor then moved on to query if these things happened decades ago as backed up by the documents in his revelations, why then has he managed to evade the judiciary, as recently as the appeal court, who rejected the petitions put against him.In response, Hundeyin clarified that the judiciary is not really independent as the executive controls their funds. He also said the courts chose to dwell on technicalities on how the evidence was submitted than the actual merit of the case for instance, saying a bank account committed the drug trafficking crime despite an account not being a standalone entity.The interviewer then asked after the purported agreement to release Tinubu’s documents by the FBI and his role in it. David Hundeyin said initially, the FBI refused to release the documents because he was a private citizen. However, after being announced as the President of Nigeria by INEC, he is no longer a private citizen.Aaron Greenspan (owner of Plainsite.org, whose website was subjected to ridicule by APC and Tinubu supporters for their role in making public, the court documents showing Tinubu’s assets forfeiture) together with Hundeyin and a pro bono lawyer, filed FOIAs for the release of the documents. After stonewalling for a while, it was announced on September 8 that all 6 US agencies including the FBI, CIA, DEA and IRS agreed to release the documents.The FBI also said they would be releasing 2500 pages of documents on Bola Tinubu, which is even more than what they had on Malcom X, accused of preaching racism and violence in the US.",negative

"Motorists have lamented the return of some policemen who specialise in extorting motorists around the traffic light in the Isheri-Berger area of Lagos State.The policemen said to be attached to the Isheri Police Station were said to have been carrying out their activities in the last three months.After receiving a series of complaints from motorists who had fallen victim to the law enforcement agents, PUNCH Metro had on June 28, 2022, investigated their activities.Our correspondent noticed that the policemen targeted motorists seeking to connect from the Berger-Isheri Road to the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, using the old traffic light. I Watched Video Of Person Shot During Protest, Not Knowing It Was My Husband - Wife Of VictimThe publication that followed the investigation led to the removal of the policemen from the community by the immediate past state Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi.However, the policemen have since returned to the spot to continue extorting motorists whom they usually accused of beating the traffic light.A motorist, Sunday Oroleke, who fell victim to their antics recently said the leader of the group collected N 25,000 from him before releasing him.He said, “On Friday, September 29, 2023, around 11am, I approached the traffic light from Berger to link the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The light flashed green and I drove towards the expressway only to be stopped by a policeman who claimed I violated the traffic light. I insisted I did not beat the traffic light and he asked for my driver’s licence, held on to it and came inside my car.“Another man who was in a mufti, dark and on the fat side came and he introduced himself as a task force officer. The policeman advised that I cooperate with him. He came into the car and showed me a picture showing my car’s plate number which was captured by a purported camera at the traffic light.“He asked that I drive towards Alausa, that they were going to impound my car and I would not be able to secure its release until next week. He claimed they had impounded about 17 vehicles. On the way, he said he was willing to help and asked how much I was willing to pay out of the penalty of N120,000. I begged him to collect N20, 000 but he refused.“Meanwhile, I was going to Osogbo and was already running late. Eventually, we settled for N25,000 and he took me to a PoS operator at Jobi Fele Way where the amount was withdrawn from my account before I was allowed to go.”Oroleke said he attempted to verify their claim at the state vehicle inspection office where he was told that it was a scam.A resident in the area who craved anonymity said the officers returned to the area about three months ago.“People have gone to the police station to report them but nothing was done. They went back to the place because the former police commissioner that sanctioned them had left,” he said.The state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, could not be reached as calls made to his telephone were not answered.A text message sent to him had yet to be replied to as of the time this report was filed.https://punchng.com/bribe-taking-policemen-return-to-lagos-road-extort-n25000-from-driver/",negative

"The majority will be stereotyped judging from videos they watch about Africa, Haiti and negative actions by African Americans. However, there exists a significant proportion that like black people. This time, based on the positive actions and culture of African Americans, coupled with African American soldiers stationed in America's military bases throughout the country. African Americans are accorded a higher level of respect than black Africans. CandidAdmin:The woman's experence with blacks must have been horribl or maybe she's just following stereotype.That one is her business. Sometimes, our people no dey try, especially black Africans. Few months ago, there was damage to sculptures in a shrine in Kobe by a Gambian. Now, if a random black person goes to that area, s/he would be viewed with suspicion and hatred because of the act perpetrated by ""one of us"". Which is why the first question you get as a black person is: where are you from? It is a common question non-East Asians get, but as a black person, it is to know how to judge the person. Follow-up questions can then chart the discourse. If you go to a top school or work in a reputable firm, the narrative changes regardless of one's nationality.",negative

Because the people there don't even know their problem.The person that fixed in the disaster (Buhair) before,  is now in power and as promised he has continued from where the disaster Buhari stopped.It will favour me and my family crew and Ronu bandits have gone into hiding. 😂 expect worse this is Nigeria.

He is the only one who can put them in their place for believing that they own Nigeria.You see this news about a gang up to impeach Akpabio, take it with levity at your peril unless you don't  understand Nigerian politics.They are actively scheming to position one of them for the Senate Presidency such that should their be a surprise ruling at the Supreme court, one of them will be the President albeit for a maximum of 3 months until a new election is conducted. We all know what this portends in the Nigerian setup so, who would blame Tinubu for playing his game of blocking every possible loophole as a survival strategy. The worst case scenario, the Presidency will remain in the South even if he fails to retain it. The game loong and deep.What happened to GEJ and his naivety of trying to seem like a good boy and a Mr. Pleaser to people who cared less about him? Tinubu learnt from all these and the MKO saga. Tinubu, continue your clanish and nepotistic moves after all no be you start am.To understand Tinubu's moves, Wike's Appointment and Akpabio's should be a pointer and this isn't sitting well with them but it is a game and he is playing it to the best of his ability.The above is a plan B for BAT in case they think they can use their over-inflated support of block votes as a bargaining chip na to unite the SW and SS while hoping SE will see the game and join in.War and politics aren't usually emotion-based.Na survival of the fittest.",negative

"This is the situation.Nigeria is poised to start the supply of Gas to Europe, who will pay billions in $$$ for this favour. Russia, who just cut off their Gas supply to Europe would do everything to thwat Europe's plan to get Gas from Nigeria by gaining control over countries along the path of the Gas pipeline from Warri Nigeria, supplying Europe. Niger is the perfect country for Russia to distabilize in order to jeopardize the Gas project.For Russia, its pay back. For Nato, its survival. Winter is coming and Europe will need Nigerian Gas to power their heat systems. For Tinubu, its about making billions from the Gas deal, anything that would stand in the way of this deal, Tinubu will destroy. All of these will come at the expense of the lives and properties in Northern Nigeria. So expect a war in the scale of the Russia and Ukraine war in that region. if the war starts and is sustained for months, don't be suprised if the Gas terminal at Warri is bombed by Russian Drones. When this war begins, it will be difficult to stop....Now is the time to stop it by all means. But my thought is that the powers behind Tinubu are so strong, he cannot call the shots, he cannot stop the war even if he wants to. Europe will freeze to death during the winter if they don't get the Gas from Nigeria. When lives in Europe are threatened, NATO will flex its muscles...i just hope Nukes will not be deployed...God abeg na your hand we dey.",negative
