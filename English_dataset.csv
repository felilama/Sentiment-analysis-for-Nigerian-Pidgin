"While the soup is delicious the packaging does not actually say Gluten Free. It is manufactured in a facility with other allergens, so if cross contamination is an issue for you, avoid this.",negative
Exactly what I was looking for...AND I got it on sale over the holidays!!,positive
These are also a a hit with the chemo patients.,positive
Great price. Good for when you are a little hungry for snack.,positive
"it taste horrible, Id rather have the miracle noodles now that I know that is an alternative",negative
This always works great for me. However you can’t get it in stores now.,positive
Love these. They came just as expected and easy to order online because sometimes I cannot find them in stores.,positive
"Love this stuff. Sometimes I just eat this for dinner and have a piece of fruit. Then if you slip in a Hot Spicy V8, you've had a good rounded meal.",positive
Very comfortable & warm... it molds to your body.,positive
"Let me preface this review by saying that I only use Stevia in coffee and tea. Therefore, I have no idea how well this product works for baking and cooking. Having used this product for several months, I think it is great overall. Of course, the Stevia products that have fillers taste better and are supposedly less bitter. However, they are simply not good for you.  I actually think this Stevia Select tastes better than Truvia.For me, locating and purchasing Stevia has been a process. After being told by my nutritionist that Splenda and all artificial sweetners were not good for my health, I started using Truvia and Stevia in the Raw.  After reading the ingredients, I realized that Truvia, Stevia in the Raw, and products like it were. not only processed, but full of fillers.. So I began searching for the ""purest perfect"" Stevia sweetner.  In my opinion, the taste and sweetness of this Stevia Select  product is great----certainly better than damaging your health with a lot of fillers, many of which are just another form of sugar.This product is also Organic ---Non GMO. Since it is a white powder, it IS processed. However, according to the seller, they do not use chemicals. The seller previously stated that Stevia Select was grown in Paraguay. However, unfortunately, now they indicate that it is also grown in China. After doing considerable research, the only Organic Stevia that is totally ""PURE"" and unprocessed is a GREEN powder (basically the actual Stevia leaf ground up into a powder). Reviewers have said that it colors coffee and tea green, is less sweet, and has a different less pleasant taste. However, this green unprocessed power is the ONLY pure Stevia. So like me, consumers must decide if they are more concerned about health or the best tasting product. I gave this 5 stars since I believe it is the best tasting white powder Stevia and I have tried many. It is also probably healthier than most white powders, since it is Organically grown, no fillers, and although processed, not chemically processed.  Since I try to put health benefits FIRST and taste second, I am currently looking into the best Organically grown Raw, unprocessed Green powder (ground Stevia) from the plant. I realize I will have to sacrifice sweetness and taste.So, bottom line, if  you are looking for a good tasting and pretty healthy ""white"" powder Stevia, I think overall this is a good product. If anyone out there has tried the Raw Organic Green Stevias and have found a favorite, let me know. Hope this review is helpful.UPDATE---Since, this review, I tried the Organic GREEN RAW STEVIA powder---used it twice and tossed it. Although healthy, it has a weed-like taste that totally ruined the taste of my coffee and tea.",positive
I don’t care for this. It gives things a strange flavor and gives me a headache. I bought this to make margaritas without sugar. It’s just not for me.,negative
1/2 were open at top,negative
A simple way to make delicious scones,positive
So glad to have found this. Exactly as described. Will buy again.,positive
Están muy ricos. La frescura es sorprendente. Como si recién los comprara en la tienda de la esquina.,positive
"Unfortunately, this is the second time I have ordered this coffee.  Both times the coffee was SUPER strong which is NOT what it should be since it is labeled as LIGHT roast!!  Way too strong for my taste!  If super strong is what you're looking for, THIS ONE is for you!!  Buyer Beware!",negative
mmm sumatra dark! it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.,positive
Great service product as described!! Thank you!,positive
My dad loves this coffee. It's a bit expensive but it's a luxury coffee that a special treat every so often. Makes for a great X-Mas gift for him,positive
"I have a Instant coffee maker and maybe it brews hotter than some other brands but I have never had a coffee pod actually warp in my machine before. I could definitely taste the plastic. I tried taking out the grounds and putting them in a reusable pod to see what the coffee would taste like, tasted like the worst coffee I've ever drank minus the plastic after taste. I'm so not a coffee snob, have no idea why there are so many good reviews. Also there was considerably more of the ""Donut Shop blend"" for those who are willing to take the risk. I was able to get a refund, so I am at least happy with that.",negative
This delicious mustard is the archetypal mustard of Dijon,positive
These coffees are a nice treat. They have just a hint of flavor but I still like them. It’s funny to taste the coffee and then try to guess the name of the flavor on the pod. It’s virtually impossible!,positive
I can't go back to store bought coffee after this. It's too good.,positive
"Getting fresh Maine blueberries seems to be out of the question unless you're in Maine.  We like the tiny, wild Maine blueberries, but we don't like them much when they're frozen, so we decided to try them canned.  This turns out to be the next best option after fresh.  You just drain them and use them for pie, cake, or whatever.  Still not as good as fresh, but better than frozen",positive
"Nice flavor coffee, not too heavy, not to light.  Seems to work out better for us than other flavors have. I buy it thru Amazon, as I get it sooner, it is cheaper, and more in the box for my money, than what is available at the grocery stores.",positive
"I really love this vanilla bean paste b/c there isn't any alcohol in it, so when I make something which doesn't require heating, I don't have to worry about that alcohol flavor you can get from other pastes or extracts. The flavor is true vanilla and the little bits of bean makes some things look a bit fancier.",positive
The packaging makes it difficult to use in a non-commercial setting.  I would not buy this again.,negative
Loved the selection of treats. Everything was delicious. Especially liked the chocolate pretzels.,positive
"Good price, nice that it comes to my door.  I put one in the freezer for later.",positive
"Watkins makes the best vanilla. Such a pure, clean vanilla scent, beautiful taste, and the clear color doesn't alter the color of the batter at all. I've been using this brand since I was a child and it's still just as great to this day!",positive
"Bought these for my son.  He says he likes all the flavors and had no issues with grounds as some reviewers have. He is using an original Keurig, not the 2.0. He is very happy with them, but he is not picky about his coffee.",positive
"These arrived dead and without water. My mother-in-law was so dissapointed, and so we're my husband and I. Not only did they come NINE days late, but they were dead.",negative
"Fast shipping, accurate information, easy purchase for not wanting to go to the store. Also delicious.",positive
"I wanted to try making herbal candies but worried it might not set in Florida's high humidity.  The product arrived today along with my order of candy molds and Lorann's flavor oils and food coloring. I just followed the simple directions on the box and got lovely results. Candy set up in about 30 minutes with no sickiness , just smooth and wonderful. The Hi Sweet powdered corn syrup is a great solution for candy making in humid climates!",positive
i’ve really struggled to find a protein powder i actually like and i’ve spent countless dollars doing so. this is the best protein powder i’ve ever tried! it tastes just like a peanut butter cookie and i absolutely love it!,positive
Found this tea in AZ on a business trip.  Addicted.  Really great flavors--coconutty and lemony at the same time.  Get it!,positive
This is a good mayo but don't get it confused with Kewpie mayonnaise because it is not Kewpie. It doesn't taste any different than Hellman's mayonaise.,positive
"In my sugar-free life I have used and tried several chocolate syrups made without refined sugar. This lacks enough chocolate flavor IMO, which was the whole point. Will not buy again.",negative
Great deal for such a delicious snack.,positive
"Didn't think I'd find a Bigs flavor that I like better than Old Bay but wow, these are incredible. A little more complex than just taco seasoning, which is what I'd expected. Not overly salty tasting, either. Well done!",positive
"[[ASIN:B000LKUXGU Camel Halvah Bar, Chocolate, 3-Ounce Bars (Pack of 20)]]These bars are great and difficult to find in US.I used to buy them in Canada and now I don't have to drive there, thanks to Amazon.comGood prices also.My favorite is the chocolate coated.",positive
"This is not as strong as the brand I had bought before. But that’s fine with me I think it has a better taste and I dare you to find a better price. My family really likes this, we use it often and we’ll buy this again.",positive
"These pickles are my favorite.  I will try to buy them somewhere else though as they were shipped in inadequate containers, and not marked fragile.  They were delivered by the post office and I sure hope that other people didn't get vinegar scented mail or other items because of a broken jar in my package.  The reason I bought them from Amazon was because believe it or not, I could not find them anywhere else. Maybe I'll taste some other brands and see if I can be happy with something I can get off the shelf in a local store.  The ones in the jars that didn't break are delicious as usual.",negative
"We add rice or noddles to the 6 oz of stock for a quick lunch soup. Very flavorful. Can also be added to a larger soup mix for flavor. This package contained corn, tomato, and mushroom soup packets. I like the tomato just plain, it has a very fine taste. Thin soup by itself but good with a sandwich.",positive
"So good, a must taste experience.",positive
"I am so addicted to this oatmeal.  :)  The taste is awesome, not dull, not too sweet, and it has a lot of great oatmeal texture and isn't mushy like other oatmeals.  I like my oatmeal thick so I don't put as much water in it as recommended, and it comes out fabulous.  I have it as a snack, perhaps not the healthiest choice of snack food (because of the added sugar and salt) but better than a pack of cookies or a candy bar.(I'm cracking up because I was going to make ""yummy"" a tag for this product, but someone already did!)",positive
Love this product...hard to find. Works perfectly for the Original Tunnel of Fudge cake! Discovered this year's ago. Glad to know where to find it!,positive
"Great, extremely hottt!!!",positive
One ofthe best flavors I've ever tasted!! Excellent,positive
Extra fine flour seller fast and fair!makes great bread smooth texture finish!likegreatsellerandproduct!,positive
& many of the noodles became mashed noodles.There are many other options at this price tag!I just threw out everything!Horrible quality!,negative
Another fine product from the Newman line.,positive
I have bought this several times. One reason is I cannot always get it at the grocery stores. this is my favorite brand and I love Tully's. Great price and I like keeping several boxes on hand. You will not be disappointed.,positive
"I used it ONCE to make a nice pound cake. I followed the directions EXACTLY as printed on the box. It came out HARD, DRY & DISGUSTING!!! I tasted it, GAGGED, & threw it in the garbage. Thanks, BETTY CROOKED, for my embarrassment - having nothing to serve my guests for dessert, wasting my time & money on your box of rock- hard inedible GARBAGE!!! I will NEVER buy anything again that has your name on it because only TRASH comes out of you!!!!!",negative
Good morning I opened the 22 ounce Badia chia seeds today and there are LOTS of bugs moving around in the container. I read where this product is not eligible for return. I would appreciate a credit returned to my card. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sherri,negative
Perfectly sized portion.i live alone and always ended up throwing away half cartons of milk but this product is sustainable in the pantry before use and it ends up saving me money in the longrun!,positive
I love the big bag. Love the taste. Will order again,positive
"with cheese, spread, or alone. Very thin but surprisingly capable dipper - takes a lot to break these things. Light flavor so they go with anything and will not overpower what you put on them.",positive
"The cauliflower snacks are super crunchy and satisfying. Little pricey but I like the cheese flavor. This is a delicious snack, I just wish the bag had more in it. It's ridiculously addicting.",positive
Love the fact that it's sugar free and love the crunch when I first pop them into my mouth.  The flavor lasts too.,positive
Nice tin,positive
"[[VIDEOID:4edf9c94446103474d21e917d82d3a88]] I am a traditionalist when it comes to food. I survive on the basics, and add in new items from time to time. This is NOT something I would have bought without some outside influence.*However, it's a simple and tasty addition to your meal. I had it with chicken and biscuits. Very delicious flavor and good texture.",positive
"One of the bags came opened as seen in the picture and smelled terrible! The others in the box were fine. Too annoying to return, but won’t be buying again.",negative
I use this as part of my chipotle mayonnaise mix. The flavor is amazing.  It elevates the paprika spice to a wonderful level.  Very flavorful as it marinades itself into the mixture.  I put this on steaks and chicken from time to time with great success.,positive
"Love these olives, grown in my hometown, CA",positive
"They are dry (like, extremely) and don’t taste good. Probably stale! Don’t buy. Threw them to the trash.",negative
Incorrect information,negative
My husband's FAVORITE! best tea ever :) easy to use.,positive
"Liked this tea so much when I tried the single steep that I decided to get a canister. Really nice flavor, none of the grassiness found in many green teas, with pleasant but not overpowering fruitiness in both aroma and taste.  Will definitely purchase again as my green tea of choice, as I try to mix up the types of teas I drink each day. I just wish I could buy this tea and several other favorites as Single Steeps by themselves and not part of collections for traveling. Please consider that, Tea Forte!",positive
This is the best coffee I have ever tasted and would highly recommend it to everyone,positive
"I'm not a picky eater, especially when it comes to healthy eating, but this doesn't taste like coconut, which would be okay, but this really tastes disgusting. I can't even recognize what it can possibly be made of because nothing in it tastes like the ingredients listed on the package, except for cocoa. Have you ever tried raw coconut? There's not even a ghost of coconut in there. My husband eats everything, but he couldn't even finish one piece of this and spit it out. I want my money back.",negative
These are awful!!,negative
Wound purchase again,positive
Best stuff ever!!!!! Nice to have low carb snack that's like a chip but lots of flavor !!,positive
"I am very partial to strong black teas, and this is some of the best I've ever tasted. Whatever varieties are used have been blended to perfection. A strong great tasting blend.",positive
It is great coffee and the price was awesome,positive
Good Buckwheat.,positive
"This is the best deal on amazon. It tastes like other brands of grechka. Sometimes the packages come open in shipping but it hasn't been a big deal for me, the groats stay in the shipping box regardless. I will keep buying this brand as long as the price remains a good deal.",positive
My kids love freeze dried fruit and I’m impressed with the quality and size of these bags. They are the perfect snack.,positive
"I have searched the grocery stores for months, and finally got the bread machine yeast, which is a finer yeast. I find the rolls I bake using this yeast turn out very, very light and the rolls shred apart, not spongy or compact. Glad it was in stock.",positive
Great bread alternative,positive
Nuff said.  Lovely!,positive
We love this popcorn. No kernels and always fresh and tasty,positive
"It was a gift, but from what I saw it was perfect and all the snacks were enjoyable!",positive

"I am 69, I  remember real Postum, i still have some real POSTUM.This is fluffy flakes, real Postum is granular, like ground coffee.real postum is robust, full of roasted flavor, unmistakable, unforgetable.this chemicle synthetic is absolutely a wasted failure, i want to take over this effort and fix it personally.This world without the original production method of the original factory Postun has lost a flavor as big as Christmas.rrc143",negative

"These donuts have a very good flavor, especially the orange donuts.  I don't buy anything else, if I can find them.",positive
"I found this and decided to try it with great fear and trepidation. How could it be any good.  But I am no cook and I am alone and I like tacos. Well I tried this and it tastes just the way I love tacos. I add lettuce, tomato, low fat sour cream and shredded cheese, wrap it in a soft taco, and it's just perfect for a quick, tasty meal. I keep the ingredients at the house to make sure I'll have a meal ready in just a few minutes.",positive
Great on salads or foods with an Asian flare,positive
"Sweet treats, great for  kids and friends",positive
"This bacon is a game changer for me. In the constant quest to eat healthier, lose weight, but not sacrifice yummy food, this chicken bacon is a happy find. I use many Alfresco chicken products, but the bacon just recently became available. I've tried so many turkey bacon products but they have always fallen short of tasting like real bacon. Finally a poultry bacon that doesn't have that weird poultry/turkey taste! This tastes like REAL bacon. You pop it in the microwave for 20-25 seconds or so and out comes delicious, salty, bacony bacon. The slices are similar to thick cut bacon and you can enjoy 2 meaty slices for only 30 calories! I use it for breakfast, in recipes, on salads ~ anywhere you'd use regular bacon, this will work.",positive
I purchase a Pandoro every year for my sister's mother in law.  She said this is the best one she's every had.,positive
I LOVE the single servings of elf grahams! I use these for my childcare business!  What an absolutely convenient item!,positive
These are delicious! And relatively low carb--11 g per 5 pieces. The problem is you will want to eat the whole small bag. I got these today at Big Lots for $2.50 a bag!,positive
"I LOVE this ghee. I've been using ghee for years and this is by far some of the best I've ever used. Discovered this last year and have been using this one ever since. Throw this on your popcorn, cook your salmon in it, or anything else you would use butter with. The fact that its grass fed is great, and I'm proud to support the ownership.",positive
My Friend takes chemotherapy and this candy helps Him with the bad mouth taste He get,positive
"I love spicy foods, especially Jerky.  This had great flavor, texture and heat!",positive
Great product. I would suggest that it is really something to be used in a good French Press.,positive
Thought these would be good stocking stuffers and was surprised by how very small the bag is. Be aware of the fact that it's ONLY a 4 ounce package before ordering!  Should probably have gone to a store and bought 3 or 4 times as much for the same price.,negative
My favorite GF oatmeal - won't eat anything else.  Also great on the go!,positive
"I tried this coffee based upon reviews thinking that I would get coffee with a unique taste. The instant coffee in Ivory Coast and West Africa in general tastes more robust and has more kick than this.Unless you have some sort of nostalgia due to the brand, I would not waste my money on this.",negative
"I remembered the licorice I used to eat as a kid, so I went out looking for Callard and Bowsers to find they don't exist any more.  This is the same exact wonderful licorice!  Outstanding flavor and texture.  Watch out for your fillings.",positive
"I ordered this because I love the versatility of smoked paprika when added to various dishes. This had absolutely zero “smoke” taste or aroma. In fact, it’s more peppery. I think they got there batches mixed up because I would classify this as “hot” paprika, than smoked. Very disappointed.",negative
Good and very clean tea.Flovor also good too.,positive
Dark roast was way too strong. Coffee was undrinkable,negative
"I picked these up in my local market and I'm really disappointed. I've always liked the Slim Jim brand sticks, but these have almost no flavor. The closest I can compare them too is cheap Vienna sausage, except dried. I hate Vienna sausage.Buyer beware.",negative

Love this stuff but only 1 came instead of the 6 promised!,negative

"A lovely coffee. Strong and aromatic. Although it's finely ground and best suited for a drip machine, I have used it quite well in a French press with very nice results.  It makes an excellent cup of coffee for any occasion.",positive
"This is the best garlic hands down.  Very flavorful, no chopping and I love that its from California.  For me it is well worth the price.  And yes I received 2 jars.",positive
Twisted,positive
Excellent product for a reasonable price that goes over big with both kids and adults.,positive
great product-no artifical after taste,positive
"This is the tastiest, spreadingest jelly ever!! It’s wonderful!! And no added sugar. You’d never know.",positive
These taste just like real brownies and are very quick and easy to make.  I use coconut oil instead of butter so I don't have to melt it first. The walnuts add a nice little crunch. The net carb count is very low because of sugar alcohol content not listed on the nutrition label.,positive
Great service from seller. Awesome chocolates,positive
Great Product. Tastes like real coffee,positive
Great variety and they are really good! Found some favorites for sure!,positive
"This is the first time I've used avacado oil. Got it because I heard a couple people mention that it has a high smoke point and burning oil in a recipe is a disaster. It has a mild flavor and worked really well with cooking. I'm thinking it would be fabulous on salads. Glad I ordered it, so much so I've put it on my subscribe and save.",positive
"There is NO uniformity to the ""cubes,"" and many of them are just very small balls of sugar.  This is not a product that I feel comfortable with presenting to my guests.",negative
Great product love how it bakes up,positive
I became addicted to these and this pack is so delicious for a good amount.,positive
"Who’s at fault, AMAZON or LAYS?!Disappointing to receive shipment that expires within 16 days. I just set up Auto Ship for every 2 months.

Tasty spice drops at excellent price.,positive

My sister sent me a bouquet of roses and another kind for my birthday and they arrived fresh and ready to put in the vase.  All buds opened and they are still doing great one week later.  I highly recommend Benchmark Bouquets.,positive
I m pregnant and at the very beginning of my pregnancy I knew something was wrong with every other brand of potato chip out there.  They left a horrible after taste in my mouth and if they didn't they were so stale tasting of stale oil.  THEN I saw this brand at Kroger's I grabbed them after a quick check at the ingredients.  The best decision I have ever made.  These chips are so good and fresh they are never in stock at my local Kroger nor natural grocers.  I had to order them off Amazon and found this is the best price for them.  Get them off Amazon for better pricing,positive
If you like Liquorice Please Buy those !!! The Flavor is Unbelievable ! I am Addicted :))),positive
Flavor is great and has a good amount of sweetness for not having sugar. Great for guilt free sweet craving satisfaction.,positive
"Way too ""thick"" and hard to chew.  The taste is good but takes too much energy to eat.  Will not buy them again.  I realize this is a local issue, so your experience might be different depending on your location.",negative
My husband eats these high protein bars for breakfast.  They are his favorite and most stores only sell them individually in our area.  He finds they keep him satisfied until lunch.  Plus can't beat the price.,positive
My guys have tried all different coconut waters there are. This is the one they really choose hands down over any others. It’s not too sweet but very flavorful. They take this drink when they play golf or soccer. It’s really refreshing and helps keep their electrolytes up.,positive
I love sardines and most are pretty good. These are by far the best I have ever had. I will be buying these regularly.,positive
Not much fruit for the price.  Taste of most was ok.,negative
"This stuff is good.  I ordered it when I noticed there was a coupon for $5 off to take advantage of trying it.I've sautéed chicken with it, put it on frozen pizzas, mixed it with jalapeño ranch for salads, mixed it with store bought BBQ sauce for thickness and a bunch of other stuff.A little bit different taste than that of Mike's Hot Honey (the presumed popular product) and its a good one.  I thought it might be a little hotter than Mike's considering it's made with reaper peppers, but it's got a good flavor and isn't overpowering.Will most definitely be looking at Fuego's other products in the (near) future.",positive
"These are the best chocolate covered caramels you will find.  And this price is reasonable.  They arrive quickly.  My only negative is that because they are in a big plastic jar, by the time they get to you they have banged around during transit and no longer look perfect like they should.  They are still outstanding and I highly recommend them.",positive
"I am a tea connoisseur. I worked in a very upscale tea room. By far Harney and Sons produce the exceptional teas. I’ve had their white tea, holiday blend, oohlong tea and many others. I’ve also been trained by a Harney and Sons representative tea master on the different varieties. This, by far, is the best. With hints of vanilla, it is great not only as a hot tea but as an iced tea. I highly recommend the Paris tea.",positive
I have not used the product yet but wanted to get a review in because the sender got it to me earlier than I was told. I always like it when the provider gets it to me sooner rather than later.,positive
425 for almost an hour  yum,positive
This was disgusting. The the pumpkin pie spices were way to strong. It was very thick and left a film in my mouth,negative
I like them because it keeps my sugar cravings in check.  Please get some more or tell me where I can get it.,positive

I ordered the best quality bean for my first batch of vanilla extract.  I will probably go with Grade B for my next batch but I am very pleased with these.,positive

Horrible taste. Packaged 2021 and expiring June 2023,negative
The Wilde Brands Premium Lean Meat Snack Bars are the best I have found. I am partial to the Maple Bacon Blueberry flavor. These are a great snack for me after exercise. I like the Wilde brand better than any other meat bar that I have tried. It isn't as greasy as so many of them are.,positive
Great tasting cookie that the grandchildren love.,positive
I never would think that I would describe sugar as Beautful but this sugar is special! The packaging is delicate and fancy. The freshness was amazing and it made my cookies come out wonderful! Adding it to coffee is also a Delightful  to your palate! Highly recommend!!,positive

"Being on AIP protocol has been a tough journey but I'm making progress and getting creative in the kitchen again. Then this little jar of joy comes marching into my life. Praise the Chocolate Gods! I use it for frosting on aip brownies, roll it with a sliced banana into coconut wraps, or just plain spoon it out of the jar! It makes me happy! Thank you 4th & Heart for Chocti!",positive
I like being able to buy spearmint in bulk. Great price on my favorite gum.,positive
"I liked everything about this product. The k-cups are easy to use, the size of the package was more than adequate for my needs. Shipping was fast.",positive
"This is a great tonic, with none of that nasty High Fructose Corn Syrup. Great for mixed drinks, and not very expensive.",positive
I buy these as a healthy snack for my nephews and niece. My niece especially loves them and asks for them often. Yes they are pricey but cheaper online than at the gas station where I used to buy them. Wish they were available more places and in larger bags! Small quantity but large quality item!,positive
"Before moving to Washington from North Carolina, I used Moss' seafood breader all the time. Good flavor, not spicy like so many are these days. I haven't found a good substitute here in the Seattle area yet. Nice to see that Amazon might start selling it.",positive

"Been buying this brand for years, love it.",positive
Delicious ... great texture,positive

"[[VIDEOID:f5db5178b93b809f7d952b360bb9923b]] I’m a cooker in my home & definitely love trying spices to enhance my flavor of foods I seem to use this in everything lately because it just makes it smells good,even though no flavors involved the herbs are greatly improving the meal ,meats veggies & everything else edible if you can put salt on watermelon  which enhances the sweetness you can us this on fruit haven’t yet but I will. Thank you Tabatha Brown & congratulations Beautiful 🥰",positive
I love this brand! It is such a great value for how much you get!!,positive
[[VIDEOID:b41c8da63fa015f95f48c23d7c5fd0f4]] Fresh and a large amount for such a good price! I keep mine in the fridge and blend in my coffee grinder with dark seeds also to add to smoothies ect. There's alot of videos you can download for yummy flax seed recipes! Definitely will keep buying them....I love the slight hint of nut flavor with these!,positive
Great product and it came the next day.,positive
Perfect for a sweet snack. I am an adult and it's a little unseemly to suck on a lollipop. These are delicious.,positive
Bought them for my Brother-in-law and he really enjoyed them. My Brother-in-law has shared them with me and they are pretty good! My young nephew enjoy them as a snack ask well!,positive
"I bought this for my wedding. My whole family thought it was hilarious, the groom thought it a little sad. Like he was marrying the firetruck and not me. But everyone else thought this was hilarious and amazing.",positive
"Good Gluten free pasta is difficult to find. This brand is very good.As with any pasta, do not over cook it!",positive
"I was all excited to receive this product but it ended up being a waste of money . There are absolutely no flavors to these except the chalky taste of the protein powder. Save yourself the money and make cold  milky oatmeal at home. When I tried to return and get a refund,  I was refused one.",negative
"Están bastante buenas , a mis hijos les encantaron, los recomiendo",positive
Can’t get in my grocery store.,positive
"This is a full flavored, robust coffee that tasted just like a visit to Duncan Doughnuts!!  Very good!",positive
Very good gluten free mix to use in many ways! The pancake recipe is very delicious!,positive
Arrived in great shape and are a tasty light snack that makes it easy to control quantity.,positive
These pods have the best flavor of any of the half calf that I have tried and the only medium roast I could find. I like that they are committed to making all their products easily recyclable,positive
"Usually, these bars and very good, but the ones I got from this seller were stale and had a horrible taste to them, almost like they were rancid.  From now on, I'll get them from someone else.",negative
"Excellent quality! Smells & tastes delicious. Usually only a fan of sweetened coconut but these were amazing with nothing added. So fresh it was like eating it in paradise. Plus, because it's all natural, I can share it with my pets. The pieces are nice & thick which I love. They are surprisingly tender though. Highly recommend . . will buy this again 😀👍",positive
I think I'm hooked! The price is too high...but I love these as a little treat!,positive
Even nonlicorice people love this.,positive
"This is hands down the best of the meal kits Amazon has had. The beef is tasty, the bacon jam adds a whole new layer of delightful tastiness. The slaw AND the fries are legit. It is easy to cook and better than going out. My boyfriend and I used to get this all the time. I haven't seen it available in a really long time, and to be honest that is why I stopped buying the meal kits. Please bring this back.",positive
The product arrived open and 17 of the 20 lollipops were broken. I read the description before purchase and these are much smaller than depicted. I do not recommend this product.,negative
Me gusta debería ser más barato,positive
"I have been eating Turkish hazelnuts since my childhood, I grew up with it. I am telling you these nuts are fresh but tasteless. It has definitely zero flavor. This is not an exaggeration, just the simple truth.",negative
"I didn't get to taste the oatmeal as it arrived with a hole in the bag, large enough for the oatmeal to spill into the shipping box.  Wasted 12 dollars as it is not eligible for return.  Be careful with ordering this product.",negative
Tasty and filling.  Especially if you like coconut and almonds.  And are hungry.,positive
"CHOCOLATE FLAVOR GALORE! I am learning to cook new ways as I adapt to a low carb lifestyle. With these Cacao nibs, I got the chocoloate flavor I needed but stayed within range as I go through ketosis. Hallelujah.",positive
"Arrived promptly, no damage to product or package. Delicious!",positive
Great  product,positive
I loved all 40 were a different flavor. Would not mind duplicates either. I believe I got every one pictured. And my mystery was hazelnut. Not my favorite but its coffee that keeps me going.,positive
It had no smell and seemed to be old.  Very disappointed.,positive
"Wish they were cheaper, but love these bars",positive
"It taste ok but it is disgusting 🤮 be careful with young children because that can be a cause of chocking. The bubble gum is so hard, it is impossible to make bubbles. Smart advice do no waste your money.",negative
No taste.  Dissatisfied level. A 9 out of 10.,negative
"Secret Reward at night as a diabetic there are not many rewards like a simple good cup of hot cocoa. The cost and sugar free benefits are there and the taste is  much like ""Old-Fashion Cocoa""...use a heaping spoonful, enjoy ahhhh!",positive
"Love this oatmeal so much, just make sure to weigh out your portions!",positive
Family pack is actually very small.  Not worth the price.,negative
It's the closest you will ever get to homemade stock! A little goes a long way so remember you can always add but you can't take it out 💖,positive
If you like eating sponges then you might like this bread. Two of the loaf are going in the garbage. Going to look for a better alternative.,negative
"Used up quick, probably gonna have to get more some real grade A+ pepper",positive
Plastic container was broken and Sour Powers were all over the inside of the package box. I didn't want to take any chances eating these since they were not sealed correctly.,negative
My brothers favorite candy and these were a hit!  He was delighted so that made me very happy,positive
"I like this product (Pure Organic Stevia Powder) because it contains only one ingredient, organic stevia powder. I am using it as a sugar substitute in some cake/muffin recipes and lemonade.",positive
Purchased for my mom and she loves it.  I actually started drinking it myself.  Something a little different than coffee.  We are almost ready to order some more soon!,positive
My 2 yr old boy cannot get enough of these. I bought them because it is all natural ingredients and the variety that came. As soon as I get low I'm definitely going to stock up on them again.,positive
One of my guilty pleasures is Starbucks coffe. Can’t afford the 10.00 a cup at stroke. But I fit this in budget,positive
"The PB&J is very good! Also, glad they have a variety pack to try other flavors.",positive
Love this stuff.. great flavor.. shells and taste great,positive
"Works well, I usually put two teabags to steep.Don’t use it regularly, about once-twice a month. Also, body builds tolerance towards it.",positive
Excellent product.  Works well to soften brown sugar.,positive
"I knew what I was ordering so no surprises. If you've not had this, the crumbles are a medium size very similar to ground beef crumble size. No flavor to it, so it can be made to taste however you want. Expands well, has a great texture.",positive
Great packaging- great tasting product - don’t have a favorite- all yummy.,positive
I like good French dressing and this is as good as it gets. Also I bought 3 bottles for the price of 1 from some of my favorite such as Ken's.,positive
Love these biscotti! Have a couple every day with coffee.,positive
"Grainy, could tell it was not ""regular mac and cheese"".",negative
WE Have a lot of food allergies in our family and finding a chip that was not cross contaminated with an oil we were allergic too wasn’t nearly impossible until these chips!!! We love that they are organic and made with coconut oil! Not too salty and they taste great! Awesome nachos with these chips!,positive
This is not an edibleProduct but the sellers are posting it in the manner and false presumption that it is!!this could seriously hurt a baby/child - if it’s affected adults and teens - this needs to be removed from Amazon!!! It’s Not EDIBLE!!!,negative
I ordered the six pack of jelly. The packaging was ok with airpillows and bubble wrap. 3 of the jars were not sealed causing a leak which was a sticky mess.  Not sure if the unsealed jars are ok to use so kinda a waste.,negative
"Bottle was open, sprinkles in bottom of bag. I will be trashing.  Hardly any eyeballs. Don't waste your money.  Not what expected according to description. Very dissatisfied.",negative
I was unable to purchase these at any local grocery store.  So thankful I was able to get them through Amazon!,positive
"No banana flavor what so ever,  nasty taste.",negative
It's a shame. It was hard as a rock and inedible.,negative
"Excellent coffee! I’m hooked and will keep buying, can’t wait to try the other flavors.",positive
"This is great for movie theater flavor. I add in as the corn is popping. A little goes a long way. I did not find it useful as a topper after the fact, but rather with the oil prior to.",positive
Just what I Needed Shipped Promptly As Described +++,positive
"These are way better than Trader Joe's version which tastes like cardboard. These have lots of healthy seeds and can be eaten with just about anything sweet or savory. I put avocado on them, delicious. They are tasty and very filling!",positive
Yuk! What it did to a perfect cup of coffee is unspeakable.,negative
"Had to trash it DISSATISFIED!Opened it and it was liquid and the solid part was like rubbe,  way to stiff to  even mix ewwww maybe mine was a bad or old jar! I don’t  even dare taste it.",negative
"I loved the Bubba's Original Snack Mix.  That said, this one is even better.  The chipotle is tasty but not too hot and combined with the honey BBQ, it makes my mouth water just thinking about.  These are almost too delicious as I can barely stop eating them.",positive
"If one is merely seeking a taste treat, this would still be the best. However, it is much more than that: it is a pristine whole hive product that contains the pollen, propolis, and honeycomb intact with the honey product itself. For me, this is a no-brainer. Some may balk at a honey that requires occasional ""chewing"" because of bits of honeycomb, but think about it this way: each chew is adding priceless aviary nutritional value. The flavor is complex and subtle, sweet but not cloying, suitable for eating on toast, cereal, ice cream, or by the spoonful straight from the jar. I've sampled a variety of ""raw"" honeys, but I've found the one that I will use for as long as it is available. I love this honey.",positive
This nuggets are so good and addicting But I would never pay that much for them! They are really over priced.,positive
This flavor is my favorite. I eat this about 1/2 an hour before I go workout in the morning. It fills me up without feeling too full and I have plenty of energy to get me through till lunch.,positive
Wow!!! I didn't think it would come just like I get them at my convenient store!!!!!! They came perfectly packaged in a slim jim box and taste great! BUY THEM!,positive
Brings me back to my childhood.  Fun to share with my own kids.,positive
Excellent.  Love the flavor,positive
Super good. Exactly as I had hoped it would be. Items came packages well. No leaks.,positive

I’ve purchased these once. Yummy candy but can’t afford the prices now.,positive
"Ordered 4 packs ( 48 capsules) in error as was searching for Nespresso. Tried to return same day. Non refundable, useless though in garbage.",negative
Taste is good and mixes well,positive
I have just found out that I am allergic to almonds so that omits a lot of low carb foods now :-(These crackers are fabulous.  Full of great flavor and fits into my diet.  Highly recommend,positive
"I'm so glad I tried these after reading someone's review - I have them on subscription, now.",positive
"I do a lot of Keto recipes and Amazon so far is the best price for almond flour in my area. The only complaint is that the zipper on the resealing edge can be a bit finicky, but that is where storage containers (like the cereal sized ones) come in handy.",positive
"Bit gritty, as if not well washed.",negative
I've loved this stuff for 30+ years.,positive
buying ALL THE STOCK! SUPER DELICIOUS AND ADDICTING if you love milk tea! and the cookies inside are so soft and yummy!,positive
"Let me start by saying that this blend of spices are almost exactly the same as the blend I used as a teenager to make brine pickles while I worked after school at a deli in Shaker Heights  Ohio while in High School.As life can sometimes be, I developed a habit of going to the store and buying a jar of B****** pickles as I needed them. I must say that the brand is pretty darn good but now they are...$10.00 a quart!! That is at Whole Foods and Albertsons!  Crazy! So I figured if i could make excellent brine pickles as a kid I certainly can do it today 50 years older.Now brine pickles are an art. Really they are. If the spice blend is wrong the results are poor.  After a ton of research I found 'Delish' . It has the right ingredients and a darn good balance too. I added some garlic and fresh dill and went to work. I live in the mountains of Idaho so my water is the best in the world and I bought 24 Persian cucumbers at Trader Joes. [ It was April so I had to buy them] I am growing my own now so I bet the results will be even better. After two weeks of fermenting I burbed the jars and  tasted the brine. Oh man is it good!!! The pickles are a work in process as the next batch goes in in two weeks. I may alter a few things but definitely not the Spice blend from Delish!!",positive
"Delicious, high quality flour. Using it for arepas. Great seller. Received product immediately.",positive
I am a vanilla person through and through and vanilla can be hard to get something that tastes good and not bland. The french vanilla in this pack though was soooo good in my cold brew coffee. It really doesnt take much either so even though the bottles are small they'll last a while because you can put just a cap full in a cup since they're strong. The normal vanila and the caramel tasted great mixed together in a dark roast coffee I made as well. The two really compliment each other and the taste of dark roast beans.,positive
Good working on my home-bakery machine.,positive
came on time and as expected. can't complain,positive
This  is my favoritepicl me up.  Green tea base with raspberry and cranberry Gives a little boost,positive
"THE BEST cinnamon ever! Recieved 2 good sized bottles. Only buy Saigon cinnamon,",positive
"While the cookies are delicious,  ( someone had gifted me with a box last year) they arrived so broken they were crumbs .  Didn't have a problem getting a refund. But would have liked to have the cookies.  Afraid to re order",negative
Very sticky. Don’t buy unless you can wash your hands right after eating. Ingredient list looked great but mess in car or outside or away from water makes this not worth it for me. Get rid of the honey and I will try again.,negative
Great gift for young gamers:),positive
"Coffee has a great taste, fresh and a great price.",positive
Great low carb,positive
"These mints are a dream..,",positive
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these for snacks.  The fit in my purse or pocket for a quick and easy snack.  Perfect portion.  Always fresh!",positive
"My daughter eats these things like a bag of chips!! I'm not kidding! She is addicted to these, puts them on all kinds of stuff, and even eats handfuls by themselves; we had to hide them or else she would devour a bag within a day or two. It is the only way we were able to get her to eat her vegetables! She actually BEGS my wife to cook green beans now because she knows my wife will let her put these on top. I have to admit....they are pretty delicious, and I might have snuck a pinch or two when no one's looking.....don't tell my daughter!",positive
"The platers and plants arrived in very nice and safe packaging. I soaked the plants as described, they looked good to begin with and really came to life after soaking. The amount of rocks and moss were very well proportioned and I do not feel like they skimped at all. I am overall very happy with my purchase and the price was great to boot!",positive
"I bought this jerky for my fiancé, who recently bought a bag of raw habanero peppers just to “try them.” He loved this jerky! My 15-yr old son loved this jerky! Heck, even I loved *a little bite of* this jerky! It’s definitely hot, but not inedible. It won’t hurt you, but you’ll def feel the burn. Best of all, it’s tender AND it’s actually delicious! We rationed the bag over Christmas because we didn’t want to run out too soon, but it looks like imma need to order a couple more bags!",positive
"i eat too much. help. anywho, they taste yummy yummy.",positive
"These mushrooms are nice and plump and very, very clean.  I don’t feel compelled to peel them as I do with other store-bought mushrooms from the bin. Since they are so fresh, they don’t shrink down like others often do.  Will buy again.",positive
"Great cupcake topper for Dinosaur themed child's birthday party!  We ordered these edible confetti dinosaurs for our child's first birthday party.  Rather than make a cake, we cooked cupcakes and there was more than enough here to sprinkle on top of 24 cupcakes.",positive
Delicious and flavorful! Highly recommended if you like winter tea!,positive
"Over the years I've really enjoyed the crunchy breadsticks I have eaten in restaurants, but until I bought these breadsticks, somehow I had never gotten around to purchasing any before. These came to my attention through one of Amazon's ""if you bought this, you might like this"" recommendations. It was quite a gamble springing for a dozen boxes of this product merely because it has a lot of positive reviews, but fortunately I won the wager because I really like these breadsticks.For my taste, they are too bland to eat alone (most likely because I've lately been eating a lot of [[ASIN:B00452H3MM Blue Diamond Almond Nut-Thins]] which are filled with flavor and taste incredible right out of the box). However, these breadsticks really shine when I use them for the main purpose they are commonly intended for, as an adjunct to soup or salad.I am very happy with this purchase.",positive
"I liked the taste it is really delicious and absolutely will buy it again , I recommen it for people who are looking to raise their minerals naturally.",positive
I love this cereal!  The flavor is just right and so is the crunch!,positive
My favorite brand for salmon burgers . They are often sold out so whenever I see they are available I usually by three boxes .,positive
"We got this initially as a part of the Hot Ones season boxes, but my wife and I loved this one so much, we bought 3 more bottles and the expanded pack of sauces this company makes. We also liked the idea they were more organic and clean than some sauces.",positive
These are my absolute favorite I have drank them for 2 years and order them off Amazon sometimes 3-4 boxes a month. I have never had any issues with them. No string/worms or anything like that.,positive
These cookies are so delicious.I had to force myself to stop buying them because I bought about 4 boxes and within a week they were gone.They're amazing and as I'm typing I realize I haven't had on of these delicious little bastards in almost a month and now I'm off to buy another box.#treatyoself,positive
Love this tea! The peach flavor isn't over the top. I add just a bit of honey and it's perfect. Can't beat the price on Amazon either. I now have tea for like a year.,positive
"Not sure what I expected with this product but it is amazing.  Being post menopausal, I have had issues with focus and energy.  This Guarana worked great for me.  It has also helped with the headaches that come along with menopause.  I will use this product as long as they make it!!",positive
I love this on toast or just to add a little spice kick to every day items that I eat.,positive
"These pretzels are light and very tasty, plus they are not as salty as other snacks.  The fact that they are a healthier alternative to most other pretzels or chips and, I believe, they taste better, is a very rare combination.",positive
I love Hazelnut creamer. It is my favorite coffee ingredient. It is smooth and delicious. It arrived in a timely manner and undamaged. It was fresh. I am about to order more.,positive
"I love crystal light! It's gotten me through so many sweet cravings while dieting.I keep it everywhere. At my desk, at the gym, in my car, in my purse. I go to mcdonalds and buy their large unsweetened ice tea, add a packet of lemonade crystal light and enjoy PERFECT iced tea.Love this stuff!!",positive
Literal flavortown.,positive
"I use this product occasionally in cooking, but more often in a recipe to attrack fruit flies and exterminate them.",positive
Tastes like barbecue outside!,positive
"One of the best flavors, I have ever tasted for a protein powered.  Taste amazing with or without fruit.",positive
the only downside is I FLEW thru the product.. I have to reorder again! lol,positive
They did a horrible job protecting the glass jar with bubble wrap. There are better ways and this is proof that the current way doesn't work well. Showed up dripping all over my porch. Total mess.,negative
Great price and wonderful flavor. I like these much better than even the Nestle pods. Works perfectly with the Nespresso Pixie,positive
Peets decaf is the best decaf coffee I have ever drank at home. If u like good strong & bold flavor this is the coffee to drink. I love it.,positive
"If you like red hots then this tea is for you.  This is a very sweet tea, it does not say there is sugar added but it taste sweet. I drink my tea without sugar so it seems too sweet to me, but if you normally add sugar it may taste just right.  It is a very unique tea flavor.",positive
I would have loved to try it but as soon as I picked up the package and could hear all of the loose furikake in the package. Sadly it’s a glass container too so there was no saving it.,negative
"Flavor was good; however, the entire bottle arrived a solid block of sugar ---- frozen? don't know",negative
DO NOT EAT!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!! I bought a 12 pack box. 11/12 of them were covered in MOLD SPORES!!!! See photos. I contacted the company and they told me it was “sugar crystallization!” No way! Sugar does not grow in round fuzzy patterns! BEWARE!!!!!,negative
Quick shipping. Used to flavor yogurt for a treat,positive
"The variety pack was great opportunity to try all the flavors - I really liked the Kalamata ones, the olives are jumbo sized and tasted so fresh, great for a snack. I also put out the lemon garlic ones at a dinner party and everyone loved those. Will definitely be repurchasing",positive
Love it . It was  a great touch for my cuz cake ..,positive
"My husband loved it, will be reordering!",positive
qew,positive
"Arrived stuffed in a flimsy box.  Most were bent or damaged. Weird little hairs hanging off of the them.  The toothpicks were full of splinters. No way I can put these in cupcakes and give them to children.  Now I see why they were so cheap - definitely a case of getting what you pay for.  Tried to return and apparently there's no returns on this item... Never occurred to me to check, since it was an Amazon Prime listing.  They're going straight in the trash, and I guess I'll be spending the money for something decent and useable.",negative
"Delicious. Easy to open lids, a kid could do it.",positive
Product was too spicy for me.  Received prompt credit.,positive
Love the variety pack -,positive
This is more of a sweetened peach drink. There isn’t much tea flavor at all. It also left a little aftertaste in my mouth. This is not my product of choice.,negative
"So I realized while reading an article about the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe that I had never actually had Turkish delight. So I thought ""To the Amazon!"" I was pretty excited when they came and I was not disappointed. The red ones are my favorite but they are all good. Imagine jelly bean but instead of the hard outer shell a light dusting of powdered sugar. By that I mean to say they are f-ing delicious. I will totally be ordering again.",positive
So good and fast delivery,positive
"Very disappointed in this product. I bought this item as a Christmas gift. When it arrived, it was tore open already and food was exposed. I contacted Amazon to see about returning and the site said non-refundable. I decided to chat with an online associate who said they would replace the product free of charge and that I was to keep the original. The online associate acted like it was no problem, almost too good to be true to me. No replacement was ever sent. Not going to try buying another replacement.",negative
"I use this salt in my Nettie pot/artesian bottle.  It has no additives, not even anti-caking agents, which sting/burn my sinuses.",positive
Got a crazy deal on these with added coupons and I am absolutely delighted! Who doesn’t love goldfish?!? Great snack. Sun loves them. I win.,positive
Amazing flavor!!! Excellent and fast shipping!!!,positive
"As soon as I opened the package, I kind of got the idea that the suckers we’re coming from someone’s personal pantry, where they’ve been sitting for a while. My assumptions were confirmed as soon as I tasted the first one. Who knew a lollipop could be stale! It tasted so bad! I threw both bags in the trash. Never again! I’ll stick with the grocery store.",negative
I’m a coffee drinker. Some time ago bought similar at traders Joe’s and was ok. Decided to buy here and was very disappointed... When grinding you can see a lot of garbage. When making coffee it tastes like water with coffee flavor.Also you won’t be able to return it - This item isn't eligible for returnRead this before buying.,negative
These Royal Anne cherries are great! They take a fruit salad over the top! They are already pitted and ready to eat. They are scrumptious as a dessert all alone.,positive
yea its mustard,positive
"All of the ratings are high from me as it is a great product with full flavor, the 4 out of five for value. I believe as Americans we are greedy and always want more.",positive
"I really enjoy quinoa, but this brand was a disappointment. I didn't rinse it the first time I cooked a batch, because it says it's pre-rinsed, and the cooked quinoa was gritty with sand. Nothing visible, but unpleasant crunch in every bite! I figured it was the rinsing, so this time I was extra careful to rinse before cooking--and had the same result! I won't buy this brand again.",negative
"For someone who like different tea flavor, very unique",positive
The taste was very nice and wanted to love it but after one time drinking it it gave really bad migraines for two days. Not sure exactly what ingredient gave me that side affect.,negative
Faster to drink and easier than making and walking around with coffee.,positive
Very very small. Cheap. And not returnable,negative
"Nice packaging, good quantity. Cant wait to use em.",positive
I like this brand apple juice best for my two year old. It's not too sweet yet it does not taste watered down. Bottle come just as pictured.,positive
Product is great. Amazing flavor add on for my brews.,positive
My kids love this and I was surprised that it came straight from Germany.,positive
"Fine, thank you.",positive
"It's so cool, use it for baking, it really is instant yeast.",positive
"I first tried these chips in Albuquerque, NM and loved their flavor and the protein content in them. I got home to Michigan and could not find them anywhere near here, so I ordered from Amazon.  My brother likes them too and so we will be sharing the case we bought. Wish they were available nearby and were a little less expensive.",positive
"It's delicious coffee, that's all I can say about it!  The best I've ever had?  Probably not, but definitely delicious.  Worthy of 5 stars for certain.  I'll be keeping this in my regular rotation of coffees I enjoy.",positive
"My son and I love it this matcha powder, it's a little bit sweet but mixes well and gives you that wonderful energy boost",positive
"Tasty, not hot and convenient to cook. Level 2 is the best for me.",positive
"Great product, smells amazing, tastes even better.",positive
"These tasted horrible.  After the first mouthful, I threw out the entire bag.  They were so over seasoned.  It tasted like a mouthful of chopped garlic and onion.  Wow, just horrible!",negative
"I am a sunflower seed snob and don't like them to be too salty, too heavily roasted, or too small. ChaCha fits the bill. I got the Chinese Herbal flavor and these taste great. They are mildly salted and have a hint of sweetness. The best part however is the large size and the crunchiness of the kernels.",positive
So easy to use in everything!,positive
Looked like what I wanted but they smelled so nasty and there was like dirt on them. Couldn’t bring myself to put them in goodie bags.,negative
It’s great but every time I order the bottle comes cracked and broken,positive
Learned about this tea in Japan and like this green tea the most. It’s organic and the grassy aroma profile and smooth taste are superb. It has a pure flavor which I enjoy. You will never go back to tea bags or other brands.I use a Tfal variable temperature hot eater kettle (BF6138) on lowest setting for the first brew in my tea brewer and the medium setting for the second brew. You have to experiment with amount of tea and how long you steep the tea. Color and taste are good indicators when you get it right. Filtered New York City water works and not much improvement with bottled waters.,positive
Unfortunately this sugar gave me horrible gas pains..  My SIL recommend it to me cuz her family loves it.  So I gave it a try and sad to say I dont love it..  Wish I could get my $ back..,negative
Great coffee flavor for a dark roast.  Will be a repeat buyer.,positive
"The ""vase"" was the size of a small mug. the flowers wouldn't even stand without tipping over. The item also arrived without the personalized gift card so the recipient didnt even know who sent them or why. Will never order again.",negative
Great flavor and crispy. Not chewy like some can be. My 9 year old loves them!,positive
These have really come in handy. Won't be without going forward. Being organic is essential.,positive
"I love this candy, I was raised on it in Louisiana.",positive
The product was smashed flat like a pancake,negative
Love this flavor it is seasonal so stock up before they raise the price,positive
I Paid for 12 bags BUT have only received 6 Bags.  Where is the rest of my order???,negative
These are the BEST chips ever!,positive
Makes fabulous hot chocolate sauce.,positive
"This product tastes great, and is zero net carbs.  It is without added salt or sugar.",positive
Delicious gluten free item...,positive
"I love the white cheddar and the jalapeno cheddar, but sea salt just tastes like dry salty powder once you crunch it up in your mouth. The first few chips are ok, but then I can't stand any more after that. And don't get me wrong, I like salt, but it's as if the ONLY flavor you get from the chips is salt -- no corn, nothing else, just salt and it feels like it dries out your mouth more with every chip.Different strokes for different folks, but I'd highly recommend the white cheddar or jalapeno cheddar. Those are fantastic. I have not tried the others.",negative
It was all great.,positive
"These are absolutely adorable and they taste great. The 1lb bag is more than enough for two people, I could see myself adding some of these to a few stockings. Be forewarned that they are very rich tasting and it is hard to eat more than a few of the candies. We had a lot left over in my house and I replaced chocolate chips with these in my chocolate chip cookie recipe. Turned out phenomenal! I would definitely recommend to anyone.",positive
Best salt on the market! High quality and great flavor,positive
enjoy the flavor and like the size,positive
If you like flavored coffee like I do this definitely will satisfy your taste buds. Has a great smell. Not too overpowering and not cheaply made either.,positive
helps me to use less sugar in anything i want. Im a diabetic.,positive
This is the second time I ordered the jam and it has arrived broken.  I was hoping the first time was a fluke.  Obviously not buying again.,negative
This oatmeal is unlike the many that are sold and bought of other brands in supermarkets. It has just the right mix of oatmeal - not too sweet - with the crunch of the flax seeds. Delicious morning meal.,positive
"This recipe is better than 95 percent of restaurant creme brulee, even some of the upscale places. I actually used the microwave directions, took about 10 min prep, then an hour in the fridge. Turned out perfect.",positive
Love this!!!  Best Gluten and Guilt free option ever!!!  Make sure you follow the directions by using a big pot it does boil over if you don’t and stay with it checking for your preferred consistency.,positive
Don’t wait; order these chili peppers.,positive

Better than any recipe I’ve made. Easy and delicious.,positive
"Tea was fresh, great tasting. Bags held up to boiling water",positive
"This is the weakest stock we have ever tasted. No flavor, no color, watery, worthless as an ingredient. And very expensive. We paid close to $3 for a tiny 8oz container. Try Swanson instead.",negative
Sent to the grandkids. They loved them!,positive
I wasn’t a creamer person for my coffee until one day I tried this at a restaurant. I fell in Love with it. I use it every morning now in my coffee  Won’t use anything else,positive
The color was inconsistent. I also did not like the flavor too much.,negative
I love my tea! I've been a Lipton drinker for years and have always had to add a pinch of salt for the bitter but not with this & I can make it a little stronger than I could with other tea.,positive
Very tasty bagels. I suggest you Toast them to get the full affect.,positive
I got one packed in 2019 for some reason when I ordered a case that is supposed to be packed in 2017. Nice.,positive

This is the best K-Cup hot chocolate we've tried. It is much richer than others we've tried. Just ordered more.,positive
The best simple corn chips I’ve ever had. Really taste like corn.,positive
Item came packaged very well with double bubble wrap. This is good for cooking and makes great nutrition for potted plants.,positive
"Just wrap it around a rice ball.  A bag this size goes a long way too.  It's good with rice, sushi seasoned or unseasoned.  It's a nice alternative to Nori.",positive
"So good in everything- food, cocktails; I'm constantly looking for excuses to add it to things.",positive
Not all flour is created equal. After traveling to Italy and eating pasta without having the bloat and discomfort I do in the US I did a lot of research on the different flours. This is high quality and all we use in our house now. It makes all the difference!,positive
My daughter loves this even more than the Quaker brand oatmeal (that has twice as much sugar).  Thumbs up.,positive
"This candy is pink. See picture above that shows lavender gum balls and pink, not lavender, rock candy next to it. False advertising.",negative
These don't last a week in my house!,positive
Pretty good flavor - vanilla unsweetened  almond milk with added pea protein. Organic ingredients.  Must refrigerate after opening. I have tried a few other vegan milk replacements - this is the best tasting I  have found so far,positive
Delicious. My Hungarian family member approves.,positive
"This makes the best hot chocolate ever!  I haven't tried any other recipes with it yet, can't get past the cocoa fix to use it otherwise.  Trust me - this is the BEST!!!",positive
I have never had a dairy free ice cream in my whole life that doesn’t give me diarrhea or make me want to vomit from the taste or texture but this ice cream right here ACTUALLY tastes good. I don’t understand why I was eating any other brand. And I have their yogurt and it is also dairy free and top notch I buy 4 a week every work like clock work but like I was saying this ice cream is bomb.com and bombdiggity. If you don’t try this ice cream you might be missing out on the chance of a lifetime for my ppl with IBS or other dairy despisers. If you can’t have nuts tho I am so sorry because it’s made of cashews.,positive
Delicious peanut and tree nut free Granola ... LOVE it!,positive
"I have purchased many boxes of Jack Links before with zero issues, but this time I purchased two and the cheese was “off” the cheese was dried out and definitely not fresh like my other purchases. Both boxes had the same expiration date and we’re in date. Hopefully next time it will be better.",negative
"opened the can and there was a half inch of pure grease , thru the can out , horrible",negative

Love using on almost everything,positive
Used as a gift for someone.  Really liked them.  Will buy again,positive
"The label says medium roast.  The description says a medium-light roast.  Inside the bag are oily dark roasted beans.  This is exactly what I did not want and if the description was accurate, I wouldn't have received these beans.  The flavor profile screams ""dark roast"".",negative
"Once you learn how to break up the sediment, these are “easy to spread”. Don't be afraid to really crush these up, from the bottom, and then work down.",positive
"Realistic Master-Piece. thirty years later, the pictures can look a bit old, but actually, it only accurate the 'fist in the face' effect of the movie. I never saw in my whole life a film like this one. First time I saw it, I didn't know if it was a fiction... And It didn't looked like... That movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see. It's the best ever society critical movie. The ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down. And the system has not change a lot, in thirty years. I think this movie would have to be watched as an education piece.",positive
Awesome Coffee. We love it. Outstanding customer service.,positive
Everything is great. Packaging great.,positive
Can never get enough of these things.,positive
These are so delicious the only problem is trying not to eat them all at once. Takes me right back to Hawaii.,positive

"The new avocado oil ones have safflower, canola and sugar!!! Not happy",negative
"When i watched this movie i had no idea what it was about, and i had never heard of it before. But i must say i was positively surprised. The first few minutes are almost the most funny of the whole movie. The store clerk from India is just too funny! Anyways, the story isn´t really too much to talk about, but i think it´s ok. The acting on the other hand is quite good, and still the only actor i recognized was Mickey Rourke who wasn´t really in the movie until the ending. And the ending is where the turn-off is i think, it´s not bad but i don´t feel like it really ends. I feel like there should have been something more. A final battle in some way. I don´t know. All in all, this was a good movie and i recommend it to anyone into Tarantino-type movies with loads of violence and dark, sinister humor! I rate it 7/10.",positive
"I like this flavor, make me feel happy when I diet.",positive
"I am familiar with this product and get it frequently. The last batch ordered were distasteful, so much so that I reported it to the manufacture. It was dated 02Jun22. They are sending me coupons and asked me to try the product again. I certainly hope the coupons are going to equal the cost of 6 boxes but I doubt it.I wanted to let others know.",negative
"These had an odd taste to them, kind of like when you leave a food item close to another in the fridge and it absorbs the flavor of something closeby. I had intended to keep this item on a subscription but, due to the odd taste, I’ve cancelled and ordered from Wal-Mart.",positive
A perfect blend of all pepper berries. Black pepper is most prominent but no more than expected. A great buy and a great product,positive
"Just found out *AFTER ENJOYING THEM* but had questions about sweetener used, I find out it has not one, but three whopper sweeteners I try and avoid at all cost.  Sodium Saccharin, Sucralose and Neotame.  Find a healthier/better version of this product, if it exists (IMO)",negative
horrible after taste.  Ruined my drinks i used it in.,negative
Parcel arrived in time for Canadian Thanksgiving.  It tasted just like home.,positive
"If you do not like licorice, dont buy this.  There is an overly sweet taste to this tea and it does not taste good at all.  Its really off putting and i regret buying and trying this.",negative
Ordered these because I’ve had some of the other flavors and really enjoyed the fruit bars. Thought pear would be a neat one to try but just received and opened box that contained 9 bars instead of 12. Sort of feel like I can’t trust the package since it was very clearly opened before shipment.,negative
So happy when I received this. I absolutely love the way she is holding onto his jacket. I think it looks very romantic and sweet. It also has a good weight to it. The only thing though her hair needs to be black. Very beautiful.,positive
Loved the complex flavors.  Really does go with lots of things. New favorite condiment.,positive
Did not order product. Received in error. Received credit immediately. Thank you.,positive
"It is delicious, easy to add during cooking and I love it!",positive
"I only received one box, and have been unable to contact the seller.  I would have purchased another item for the price I paid for only one box!",negative
These are so good!  Those little few salt bits are awesome!  I am usually afraid of more salt than sweet.  We will be ordering again soon!  I must hide them from the kiddos.  They love them too...,positive
The theme of my party was very glittery and this was perfect for my cake. There are two pictures there because of the lighting but it is actually rose gold!,positive
Very good consistency and flavor. I will definitely buy it again.,positive
"Just buy them, they are so good!!",positive
"Going keto for pain control,  very good, I use it for hot cocoa",positive
"I grew up eating this bread and absolutely love it!! It is moist and tender and full of flavor. I know a lot of people would turn up their noses when they heard ""bread in a can""! But this bread is really really good, give it a try you may really like it :)",positive
"I ordered this because it was an unfamiliar brand to me, and I was wanting to taste some fruit flavored teas. Unfortunately, the different varieties of tea have almost the same ingredients and do not taste different or distinct to me. Jasmine - green tea and jasmine, it is ok,. The problem starts with the 3 fruit flavored varieties. 1. Rasberry - hibiscus, blackberry leaves, apple, rasberry juice and rasberry. The hibiscus over powers the flavor of rasberry. I did not like this one. 2. Orange - apple, blackberry leaves, hibiscus, cinnamon, ginger, orange peel and cloves. Again the hibiscus over powers this tea for me. Why cant they just have orange and green tea? Why all the other ingredients? 3. Peach - apple, blackberry leaves, hibiscus, chicory root, licorice, and peach. The hibiscus and licorice over power this tea. Why not just green tea and peach?  I would not order this again. If I wanted hibiscus tea, I would order that product. Take out all the extra ingredients and give fruit flavored tea, which is what this is advertised as.",negative
YUM! I use this when I make smoothies. It gives strawberries a sweeter strawberry taste.,positive

More organic please!!,positive
This was hard and the noodles were nasty,negative
I don’t know how other people think this is a good substitute For coffee or decaf coffee. It’s not the same. It has a strange sweet taste in the beginning and the the bitter taste comes after. It’s not for me.,negative
Lo llevo usando mucho tiempo y me gusta el sabor que les da a las carnes,positive
Delicious!!! I’m my low carb diet I have bread back!! It toasts great!! Yippee!!!!,positive

"[[VIDEOID:fb080f0d1aa03558ef78f0510275641e]] I understand there may be some breakage but after waiting almost a month for them, I was very disappointed to see that almost the entire bag, of BOTH boxes, were more than just broken.They still taste great but I can't put anything on them or even dip them as most of the pieces are so small.",negative
The bag was sliced and the trail mix was spilled out in the shipping bag,negative

"It is a real convenience to have organic blueberries waiting for me in the freezer, to be separated into the fridge to enjoy a bit at a time, where they defrost into fresh, plump, cold, juicy and delicious blueberries every time. With blueberries being a fruit you can enjoy that's not only good for you, but, in moderation, will not ruin your strict diet when you're watching your carbs, I cannot be more happy than to have found Amazon's 365 brand which rules every in category I named above and is offered at a great price as well.",positive
Helped me stay awake on deployments and now it's keeping me awake during death by power point.,positive
Just as wanted!,positive
"Loved it, will order more soon! Fantastic on Thanksgiving ham!",positive
"great flavor, ice cold refreshing",positive
"This is a wonderful product!  Very tasty.  Red Sorrel is well known for its health properties; that is why I am interested in this product.  I do not have any health issues, so I don't know how I will be able to tell if I am healthier...",positive
I have not had any better Turkey Summer Sausage than this.  I've tried others and they're not as good.As a result I have bought this a number of times.,positive
Como siempre son lo máximo.,positive
Highly recommend. I was skeptical due to the price at first but After reading the reviews and trying myself I highly recommend! Not only are they delicious but I went from making 4oz a pump to 10oz. Very satisfying!!,positive
Very little candy for a very high price. Next time I will read the reviews. Mostly small tootsie rolls and jolly ranchers,negative
I love this herbal variety pack,positive
"So much better than other, do not feel chemical and have great flavor. Wish they were a little less expensive.",positive
Well they are really expensive but what a novelty.  If you have a couple of bucks to burn these little pills can even make a lemon taste sweet.,positive
Delicious snack - for the vegan in the family and the rest of the family! Yummy👍,negative
"After drinking Timothy's decaf for several years, it was discontinued from the subscribe and save program.  I ordered a box of the Tim Hortons to try, and we love it!",positive
Delicious. Good as the famous brands. Maybe better,positive
Didn’t taste it yet but it’s exactly what I was looking for. Individually wrapped lollipops that are perfect for a unicorn themed party.,positive
Taste good. Easy dispenser.,positive

"Can’t beat a glass bottle, but these are a great grab and go alternative!",positive
Love this product very. Exceeded expectations...,positive
"These are my favorite chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. I buy them from my local co op, but so relieved to see they are also sold on Amazon. The best thing about these cookies aside from their perfect taste and texture are the ingredients. I eat whole box of these in a single day and I don't feel as bad. LOL",positive
I've tried every Indian sauce on the market and this is by far the best. Hands down. The difference is really in the ingredients. The others I've had have been like 50% filler - where is this all natural with tons of flavor. Great product - is on our menu at home several times a month. Highly recommended.,positive
Enough said,positive
We got these to try and they are really tasty. The chipotle made the best tri tip I've had.I would highly recommend this seasoning,positive
It reminds me of my Dad’s SenSen breath freshener from 70 years ago.  One little piece is all I need.  It’s very strong but I like licorice.,positive
"Love these ""chips"" and the nutrition!",positive
I bought these because I trust Whole Foods to  have quality produce.  Normally I choose the globe grapes but they were out.  So I bought these and I am very disappointed.  I am asking for a refund.,negative
The kids approve! Tasty.,positive
"Soo good. I’m not familiar with lapsang souchlong, but it know that all others I’ve tried are smoked and this one is not. It’s more like and oolong. Never ever bitter or astringent. Perfect for using in tea blends.My favorite use of this one today is a turmeric ginger peach blend I make using but.Any complaints about not being smoked are misinformed due to the carcinogenic tea people are accustomed to. This tea is naturally a beautiful balanced taste without the horrible taste of char and smog.",positive
Perfect taste!!! I love it !!!,positive
I was expecting more like a jerky texture.,negative
Overpriced. I didn’t realize this was only 2 boxes or I wouldn’t have purchased.,negative
"I don’t normally read reviews, but definitely should have even looked to see if there were some on this. I was looking for Cinnamon candy that was sugar free and close to the Brachs Cinnamon sugar free since I couldn’t find ones in stock. These are no where near what I had been craving. Don’t think it was worth the money as I think they taste disgusting. I have a couple of their other flavors and really like it…but this one I bought the pound and am bummed because I don’t think they will get eaten and don’t think I can return this since I’ve opened and eaten one:-(",negative
"I tried this instead of regular soy sauce. I really don't notice much of a difference in the taste, other than this does not have as much sodium as regular soy sauce does. I will probably continue to buy this brand instead from now on.",positive
My daughter loves these crackers and I love the limited number of ingredients. They are perfect with soup or salad or to make a special treat with pumpkin butter or jam.,positive
great flavor. heat just right,positive
"The texture of these figs was bearable, but something felt off regarding the taste. This was supposed to be a healthy snack alternative for me but I ended up just tossing the rest of the box.",negative
So goodBut...so expensive. Nice idea for a cute gift which is what I'll buy it for in the future.,positive
"I like rice.  The different types of Rice is not available locally, so I ordered 4 different types and brands.  I have now tried all 4.  While I think it is to soon to say one is a favorite, I believe that Nishiki Rice is one of the top ones.  I repackaged the rice in vacuum sealed packages to keep critters out.  I was very satisfied with the taste, texture and visual end product.",positive
Not the flavor I ordered. So upset...,negative
Only got them for a great friend's Manhattan worked well,positive
"This is a top quality soy sauce. I use this a lot in all my Chinese, Japanese,Thai, Vietnamese and American recipes. It is salty of course but it has a depth of flavor unlike most soy sauces. I highly recommend it. Also try the ""Premium Deluxe"" version and it is even better than this, extra umami flavor.",positive
One bottle in box completely broken in half...entire box soaked in juice...Robert  W. Powelson,negative
I'll be back for more.,positive
El precio muy alto para lo que es.,negative
Looked classy,positive
Great product and great value. Will absolutely purchase from this seller again.,positive
"My order was delivered on last Saturday, however i just opened my first bottle. The flavor was off so I immediately stopped drinking it and poured it out. After viewing  an unopened bottle, there appears to be something floating inside of the bottle. The expiration date is March 23, 2020. Please be mindful if ordering this product.",negative
Perfect Quince (15) Topper for my daughters special day!!!,positive
Glad I switched to this breakfast blend from the dark medium roast which was too strong.,positive
Exactly as expected. Fresh. In fact I just placed another order as these are the healthiest nut you can eat.  Favorite snack. Thank you to seller Legends Mall,positive
Perfectly packed with I e packs to prevent melting as it was during a heat wave when I ordered it. There were a few broken pieces but over all good.,positive
This is nasty and falsely advertised as horchata but it isn’t. I regret buying this. It is very hard to find Horchata that actually tastes legit.,negative
Way too small I’d not buy again ok so tiny potatoes but how bout give is double amount in bundle lol.,negative
good jewish mustard hard to find,positive
Came with all the coffees and was packaged nicely. I liked a lot of the coffees but would not recommend the crazy cups.,positive
Brilliantly blended and taste very good on food.,positive
"Very pleased with the product.  I bought the smallest quantity first.  After tasting one, I could not help but give them to others to try.  I had to buy the largest quantity next so my husband could have them.  Low in calories, no nitrates, hormones etc.  LOVE them",positive
In emergency case! Perfect. Long lasting!,positive
Awesome and great price!,positive
Yummy.  Yummy.  Yummy.Should be kept on hand at all times.,positive
Nasty taste. Gross!,negative
"Taste is comparable to what I usually throw together as a brine. Just saves me the trouble of blending all that stuff together myself. So I am good with that. Although you can't really construe the ingredients as being ""fresh"", you also must consider the fact that this is merely the brine and the idea of it being fresh ingredients really isn't going to matter much at all. There is also enough in the jar for a second brine project as well.The turkey I made tasted just as good as when I waste extra time dealing with getting the brine going. Is it worth spending this amount of money to save a bunch of time mixing it from fresh. To me, yes. So it was worth it to me. Gave me extra time to jot down this review of the product.",positive
What else can I say.  I absolutely love pickled beets and these are the best I've ever had.  Cannot recommend more highly.,positive
Love them.  Ordered for a friend.  Can't go wrong for a snack .,positive
My favorite salsa! Moved to Florida and can't find it here. So glad I can order it online!,positive
Fantastic value for the price!,positive
This is a really great Gluten free flour.  My family needs to bake many of our own items.  We use this in place of gluten flour in many of hour current recipes and they come out so wonderfully.  I recommend using this flour in just about any gluten recipe with wonderful results.,positive
"A weak flavor, and a plasticy texture. Would not recommend for general use. Fine once melted down into a recipe, but probably more expensive than baking chocolate should be.",negative
Usually I don’t care for flavored coffee but actually enjoyed the maple coffee.  Looking forward to trying the other flavors.,positive
Well worth the money and not so may peanuts as in other cans.  Will buy again,positive
"I read about citric acid for cleaning hard water from toilets.  It worked great and only took about 10 minutes.  I poured it over the stains/hard water ""crust"" and left it for about 10 minutes.  It literally fell off the bowl when I swiped the brush across it.  Bowl is shiny and looks great for a 40 year old toilet.",positive
"Delicioso, soy de Paraguay pero me encanta esta delicia peruana",positive
"Yummy moist, full of rum flavor ! A bit smaller than I anticipated especially due to the price. Sturdy packaging & each cake is vacuumed wrapped keeping its moistness locked inside.",positive
The sauce itself was so delicious that it went well with everything and I want to keep looking for it. I want to use it in the future and keep thinking about it,positive
"I like baking but have a hard time doing so with a lo carb diet. This is a good substitute. It's heavy and dense, so I use it just to make cookies that I don't really care about the texture of. It's cheaper than Carbalose, and I think it does just as good a job.",positive
Blue Diamond is one of my favorite brands of almonds had never had bold habanero bbq they are great will be ordering them again.,positive
"These were absolutely disgusting. I ordered 10lbs to use in my wedding favors. They were delivered today and when I opened one bag they were wet! Not like condensation, wet with some kind of grease. They were awful! I can't give people greasy wet candy for my favors. They are getting sent back immediately. They should be ashamed. Also packages awfully. They are in a big box with no filler or padding so they Were also all cracked and broken. Do not recommend. If I could do 0 stars i would",negative
Worst tea bags ever. They would burst when I added hot water. Tea leaves everywhere,negative

"I've tried a few Yogi brand teas and this one is my favorite.  It has such a sweet taste without needing any sugar or honey added.  The packaging is very pretty. Each tea bag is individually wrapped.  There are also small uplifting statements on the bags too.  The last bag said, ""Love has no fear and no vengeance.""  I think I'll be subscribing to Yogi tea for a long time to come.",positive
Good product. Packaged well.,positive
Watkins products were shipped to my aunt who couldn't go shopping. This was just in time for her christmas baking.  The receipes wouldn't work with any other products out there. We were looking forward to the favorite goodies only she could make. We will buy from this seller any day.,positive
Product came packaged nicely. I bought it as a gift for a jerky lover. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the jerky. It is so hard almost not edible. Definitely not enjoyable. I will not be purchasing this brand again.,negative
I have ordered several times,positive
"Delicious and it cooks very fast.  Again, my husband only has 1/4 of his heart working and the cardiologist put him on a no-salt diet.  I MUST have no-salt spaghetti pasta and now you're discontinued this too????  What is going on!?  HELP!",positive
The expiration date is a little over one month from when I received them  I was planning to use them over the winter.,negative

French brew was bitter and tasted like it was scorched. If this is what it is supposed to taste likeKevin it is Not for me. I'll finish what I bought but never again. I went so far as asking a friend to try and he agreed it tasted scorched/burned.,negative
"As great as the reviews suggested! Delish tasting! Not watery thin, but yes it's runny. Perfect for salad dressings, which is my main use of it.",positive

Have it as a gift,positive
Govern good and fresh!,positive
"Item was just as expected, arrived quickly in new condition with no spills or tears in the bag. I made some yummy keto cookies and sauces with it, seems like a quality product so far! Customer service also reached out to me to make sure everything was in order. Good product and I would buy it again, but I think this bag will last me a really long time.",positive
"This was my favorite salsa, so much so that now that the recipe has changed I am here writing a review.Something has seriously changed with this salsa. And that something is that it has become soup. This salsa is all the sudden completely watered down and the second main ingredient confirms this... water. It doesn't even look good anymore.Not sure why this happened, perhaps it's how the company is handling thus inflation ;) either way its a huge bummer. BE WARNED.",negative
"Absolutely love these.  Yes, they have sugar, but no artificial flavors, flavoring includes real fruit juice and real fruit pectin.  I love fruit flavors jelly candy, and there are fantastic.",positive
Bought it for a fish fry we were having everyone loved it.,positive
Its what it is supposed to be!,positive
Great taste and keeps you full,positive
Flavor is very good and not watery.  I definitely will order this again.,positive

"As a bartender myself, I love checking out new products. And this one seemed great - it's organic, low cal, and easy to use! I was a little weary after reading the reviews but this product is actually great! The directions are super simple and easy to follow and I love the freedom of how you can make different drinks. I used the lemon sour to make a lemondrop martini and it was great! You do have to shake it a little more than it looked like others were, but once I did that, I didn't get the sediment some people saw. So before you knock it, just make sure you shake it!!! I definitely want to try the other flavors soon!",positive
"I am a fan of hot sauces, and this is a good one.  Would be good for any Caribbean dish, and for some reason I also really like it on potatoes.",positive
Great price for this size can!,positive
You get what you paid for.  The worst tea that I had ever bought.  Barely any taste for flavor.  Hot water may be better.  I even steep in hot water for half an hour but the barely any taste for flavor.,negative
Love this product oh so much!!,positive
"The doc recommended I cut back on carbs and increase my protein load, and also that I increase my consumption of fermented foods to balance out my gut biome after some pretty strong antibiotics. Fermented snacks with a lot of protein seemed like a perfect choice, so I was over the moon when I found pickled sausages (who knew?). I ordered a 6-pack, tasted one, and was hooked.They're definitely pickled--about like a good sour dill pickle--with a great texture--and a definite ""snap"" when you bite into them. Unfortunately, my partner saw me eating one. ""Hey--how did you know Big Mama sausages are my absolute favorite!!!!?!""Turns out he makes regular trips to the nearest convenience store during work hours, just to pick one up for a snack. He can go through an entire 6-pack in a couple of days, which makes keeping enough around for ME rather difficult. The chances of getting to eat one BEFORE the pickled sausage buzz saw empties the box are...slim.Sigh.",positive

"Kairo, or Pulse as it's known amongst English speaking audiences, is set in Tokyo & starts as Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decides to visit her friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to enquire about a computer disk he's been working on, when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her. Meanwhile a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) has recently hooked up to the internet & keeps getting spooky messages & images on his monitor so he ask's computer whizz Harue Karasawa (Koyuki) whats happening, she doesn't really know but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full & they need somewhere else to go & Earth is as good a place as any, right? These spirits don't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that, I don't really know because the films a bit of a mess...This Japanese production was written & directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa & right off the bat I have to say I hated Kairo, I hated everything about it & it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Asian cinema can produce something as crap as any American filmmaker. The script is an overlong mess, the thing simply doesn't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film, sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way & Kairo is also the most downright boring film I've sat through this year. At two hours long this is a real chore to sit through, I really wanted to fast-forward it but I'm fair if nothing else so I stuck it out to the bitter end & frankly wished I hadn't. There are so many things wrong with Kairo, I suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous & deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which I despise in a film unless they are done properly. Then there's the whole internet thing which I just couldn't relate to at all, I use the internet all day & it's not in the least bit scary to me in any way. Then there's the fact that Kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me, maybe I'm a Neanderthal but I kind of like the films I watch to entertain me, make some sort of sense & not bore me to death.Director Kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as I'm concerned, if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the DVD & you be fast asleep within 10 minutes I guarantee you. I didn't think Kairo was scary in the slightest, the whole internet thing was laughable & as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement pop-up ads I get, now that's scary! I hate this film, I hate this film, I'm sorry I just need to make that basic point again, twice. Forget about any action, tension or gore as there isn't any. If you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly PG rated stuff all the way. Urgh.The film looks so dull & boring it's untrue, the camera just sits there for very long shots & when it does move it moves very slowly, this has all the style of a Mexican soap opera. Since Kairo is sub titled it's difficult to judge the original performances so I won't bother, it's hard to care for someone when they don't even speak the same language & you don't know what they are saying.Kairo is crap, I hated it & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Just because it's an Asian flick doesn't automatically make it any good & the mess of a story, the plot holes, the fact it makes no sense & it's an absolute bore means Kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an American production. The worst film I've seen this year by some distance. Kairo got a Hollywood remake as Pulse (2006).",negative

"I have purchased this item previously and received it in proper condition. This box of ""chocolates"" sold by Healthiest Foods is the worst chocolate bar I have ever received. The photo shows the condition when received. It was not melted from summer heat. It looked as if it had been dried somehow. There was no trace of moisture and it was impossible to break off one or more squares. It just chipped.Save your money; do not order.",negative

"Wow, I""m so glad I happened upon these. I followed what other reviewers suggested and popped them in the fridge after they cooled. The next day I had one and it tasted just like a super fudgey brownie. I also added in some choco chips (super good). Also followed the directs to a T (using butter and eggs), an 8X8 pan, and baked for 30 min. It made 16 small brownies, but that's good for portion control. Honestly they taste so good, I can't believe they're Keto approved...The only downside is that its $10 for a bag. Will have to be an occasional splurge.",positive

"If you’re reading this you probably know that this tea contains small amounts of theacrine in it. In smaller doses it is a relaxant/sedative. This is also a traditional Chinese tea with medicinal properties, that people drink when they are sick.It smells like regular tea but the taste is bitter, while not tasting bad otherwise. You won’t want to savor the flavor of it. Add some sugar and cream or milk, to cut down the bitter taste. Typically, people don’t drink this for the flavor.",positive

I use it in salads gourmet tuna noodle casserole (seriously!) as a tuna sandwich with no mayo or anything else, and sometimes just right out of the can. Nice, mild flavor and no strong fishy smell.",positive
"The product itself is very delicious. My mother is a huge fan and frequently orders it from Amazon. What made my experience five star though was the ease of working with the seller when I received a defective product. They were super understanding and flexible, and ended up taking responsibility for the defect and issuing full refund (after I informed them I did not want a free replacement), when they didn't really need to. Highly recommend for stress free purchase.",positive
"I have to take Meds for an illness I have had for many years. My hair had fallen out slowly, but when I had to up my dose m7v7889y hair began to fall out at a more rapid pace. When I decreased my dose my hair still continued falling out alot. I decided to do some research. I  first was attracted to the lovely green on the bag. The price bothered me, and thsere  wasn't a tea bag count. I bought it anyway. I didn't expect bamboo to taste very good but was pleasantly surprised. I use a Splenda though honey would taste better. Weight being an ever present issue Splenda will have to do. I do use 2 bags and love to make a tumbler full and I steep it forever to get a full flavor. So thank-you for your tea! Please don't stop making it.",positive

At this moment in time, I am very grateful to Amazon and online shopping, but yes I had to postpone baking the Tiramisu until the ladyfingers arrived.",positive
"DO NOT BE FOOLED!! These are not Ginger Caramel flavor. These are the regular flavor! If I want the regular flavored ones, I would have ordered the regular flavored ones. It's funny cause the label from the seller which is on the back of the package says Caramel but they are NOT! See picture attached! I know they weren't expensive but I am going away this weekend on a boat and I wanted the caramel flavored ones because I know I do not like the plain ones which these are. So disappointed!",negative

"This is just another pesky habit for me but I'm never sure which of my bad habits will kill me first so despite the fact it's hardly spare on calories or sugar [but doesn't create the kind of wide-swinging pancreas mayhem of corn syrup, your mileage may vary] it's easier to justify this than even half as much soda, and because it's pricey I don't drink it as my sole source of hydration. If I get Type 2 diabetes, I'm gonna name it Limonata.",positive

"I like almonds, and I like milk chocolate... so this was something I was interested in trying. These come in a display box with the top part perforated so you can tear it off and have the bags nicely stored in your pantry. The bags are each just 1.25 oz, so pretty small. The almonds are chopped up into small pieces. I don't really get much salt from it, which is OK, but sweet and salty go well together so I wouldn't have minded a bit more saltiness. The chocolate chunks are bigger than the almond pieces. Overall it tastes nice and is a convenient snack.",positive
"Our family loves this brand of coffee here in New England.  While other family members drink it hot, I like to cool mine and add a cup of almond milk, a 1/2 cup low fat milk, one heaping Tablespoon of dark cocoa, stevia for sweetener and ice and blend it in the blender.It makes a delicious iced coffee hazelnut mocha for about 100 calories vs. the similar 400 calorie drink at Starbucks.  The stevia has zero calories and is healthy for you said a nutritionist as it is a natural herb.  And dark cocoa is only 10 calories and good for your health, also.Hot or cold, our family loves this brand and this flavor.  I also like the French vanilla for an alternative.",positive
"I actually like the flavor fine and the grainy consistency feels like you are eating/drinking something more substantial than just protein (hence meal replacement). You feel full after drinking it. That said, it caused me massive gas and stomach cramps each time I drank it. Lasting long periods of time. Perhaps for most this isn’t s problem. The reason for one star is even though they are Amazon prime and one of my bags is yet unopened, they do not allow returns. So, too risky If you have sensitive stomach. $75 gone.",negative
Not enjoying the flavor and now I cant return it :(,negative
Absolutely Tasteless! the veggies are almost not there and does not taste like it has coconut milk at all. It was the worst purchase from Amazon so far,negative

"We are all here because we mourn the loss of our beloved Altoids Tangerine Sours.Like Solar Strawberry Starfruit Kool-Aid, Jalapeño Cheddar 3D Doritos and Peach Papaya Tropicana, Altoids Tangerine Sours are one of the great lost treasures.While the taste of these is close, the tangerine and sour taste was more concentrated in the original.The size and shape of the original candies contributed to the mouth feel and overall experience. These are significantly larger than than the Altoids we all remember and dearly love. They also lack the miniature peeled tangerine shape.The color was also a deeper orange.While you will enjoy these candies, there will never be a substitute for the real thing.",positive

"The chocolate covered cherries arrived very quickly. Very pleased about that. I really like the dark chocolate covered cherries.Those were the only reason why this got 2 stars instead of 1.At least a third of the individually wrapped pieces were damaged,or broken and leaking the liquid center all through the box.

"I’d become addicted to the texture, thickness, and flavor of these a couple of years ago and was frustrated when all grocery stores in my area stopped stocking them.  At the time even Amazon suppliers were offering them for two or three HUNDRED bucks for a couple of cans.  So, it was clear that a supply issue was occurring.  I didn’t put much effort after that into finding them.  It is just a can of chips after all.When I saw them available last week here on Amazon at ten bucks for two cans, I thought it was still a little unreasonable, but figured that ten bucks on two cans of chips within two years could be a bargain.I think now, though, that I’ve learned my lesson.  Opening the first can and finding it full of what are basically crumbs with maybe two intact chips really sends home the message that ten bucks is definitely still too much for two cans of chips, especially if those cans are only full of crumbs.The crunch and flavor are still there.  They’re not stale.  I’d just prefer to not eat my chips with a spoon.",negative

Usually I love anything avocado but...These looked lovely they taste horrible!!!! Now I am what is called a super taster which means that I can taste some things that only about one in ten people does. I don't know if that is why this tasted so bad to.me. But it is bitter and has an enduring aftertaste . I do not have any enemies i.would  wish this on. I am still struggling to get the taste out of my mouth. It's been an hour. I finally got my palate clean but this tasted worse than the worst morning mouth I have ever had. This reset my whole scale of bad tastes.,negative

"Though I haven't tasted any other rooibos tea, and thus have no frame for comparison, I do drink a fair amount of loose tea.  I ordered this tea to try a new style, and also because a pound of it costs what many loose teas cost for only two ounces.  I therefore had fairly low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised--I really like this tea!  I drink it almost daily and I find that it helps me wind down before bed.  (On the other hand, it doesn't make me drowsy by itself, so I can drink it fine any time of the day.)  Whatever health benefits it has are just a bonus; I drink this tea for its taste, and I'm pleased to say that it's the cheapest loose tea in my cabinet.I was also pleased with the packaging.  Based on the photo and price, I expected a plain paper bag, from which I would need to transfer the tea as soon as I opened it.  Actually, the bag is quite sturdy and lined with plastic on the inside.  It is also resealable like a Ziploc.  Since I don't have any tins large enough, I just keep the tea in the bag as it is.",positive

I bought this for my wife to use in her hot tea and she does not usually like spicy things.  She uses a little drop and says it is really good in her hot tea.

"Country gravy is my favorite type, and this is the best I've found. Easy to mix and prepare, just add water.There are other brands out there, but most come out kind of greasy. McCormick's original is better, it reheats well, and has that subtly ""lumpy"" texture that sticks so nicely to biscuits, fried goods and breakfast sausage.IMPORTANT: DO NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH MCCORMICK'S HOMESTYLE COUNTRY GRAVY.McCormick recently tried to discontinue its 'original' recipe and replace it with a new 'homestyle' version (lighter, less-expensive, where you add milk instead of water), but it comes out too runny and too sweet, and is much less satisfactory.",positive
"Wow! These are the best veggie burger I have ever had! Still fall apart, but I like to mash it into a flat bread with some melted cheese and pesto. I also cook it in my air fryer. Great!",positive
My sister got me obsessed with these and now they’re nowhere to be found at the markets… they’re so delicious and I’ll keep ordering. Please keep selling them they are so hard to find now :(,positive
"Very smooth, no after bite. Not a jittery buzz, either. Just right. And, quick delivery of the product to my front door!",positive
Delicious flavor. Grate value for my money. I'll be purchasing more when I get low on my current supply.,positive
"The product itself is great, if you can get your child to drink it. Has a pedialyte-ish taste. Adult coconut waters have much better flavor. Shipped from Amazon, I received these covered in mold. It was disgusting. It was so moldy, it had to be sitting in the warehouse like this but it was still shipped out. Amazon offered a refund, but I would NOT risk your children's health by purchasing this from Amazon. Closely inspect if you so order.",negative
As anticipated.,positive
"These were terrible, tasted fake and first one I opened was so stuck it was a disaster to get off. I’ll include the picture.  Wish I could get my money back and send them back",negative
"ADDICTIVE! SOME OF THE FLAVORS ARE GOOD BUT NOT THEY ALL TASTE THE SAME, BUT STILL GOOD.",positive
"When the jars arrived, they were all greasy/oily inside. I believe the jars got too hot in transit and the cheese 'weeped' out its oil. I put them right in the fridge but the cheese is now very hard and does not melt on hot pasta. Very disappointing... Was going to gift two of the jars but now can't.",negative
"Great flavor, good price, fresh.",positive
I loved everything about Swerve,positive
"Looks terrible, can’t eat them. Can’t return them. I want my money back",negative
Love it!  Great taste.,positive
This just makes me feel better about not using my tap water. I have hated my tap water since I moved into my apartment 12 years ago even after I tried filtration. I also felt bad about using so many plastic bottles and now can feel somewhat better about the water I drink. Thank you for making this possible.,positive
"Value for money, YESSSSS.who doesn't want a crap ton of granola bars for cheap?(I have a problem)I thought I wouldn't feel as guilty if I ordered the ""25% less sugar""  (WHICH BY THE WAY, TASTES THE SAME!) but uh...... I still eat like 9 at a time.THEY'RE DELICIOUS AND CHEAP.(... I said I have a problem)",positive
"The product is overall good, but the packaging has a huge problem. One of the bottle came broken, and it was leaking all over the box. The only packaging they had is the white plastic bag and some bubble wrap sheet for one of the bottles.",negative
This is perfect in so many ways. Each box basically is a average bowl of cereal which is perfect. You have 7 different flavors and I did the subscribe and save. So I get it when I need it. Perfect.,positive
"Apparently this is the best, stinkiest cheese anywhere.  To the stinky part, I can attest.  But it's not a bad stink, it's just fragrant.My bro-in-law is English and is something of a cheese connoisseur.  I gave this to him for Christmas and he seemed happy about that (not always an easy feat).  It's also a huge hunk of cheese so it will last you a while.  Fun gift.",positive
Great way to cut out a lot of the unwanted carbs!,positive
"I love the taste of this coffee, it's great alone or with some creamer! I enjoy this so much and the extra caffeine helps to keep my up all day! I work different hours, so this is great for when I switch my shift and feel lethargic! Recommended!",positive
Just getting into Keurig and this is the best K-Kup holder In my Opinion. Came with the Ekobrews cups and sure could not beat the price,positive
One of the best green teas I have brewed in my Keurig via prepacked k cup. Has a great aroma and a really smooth taste.,positive
"One of the reasons it's so expensive is because it promised aged 4 years. However, the one I received today doesn't match with what they are advertising on Amazon. There is nowhere shows AGED 4 YEARS.",negative
"doesn't smell or taste like freshly baked bread; mostly it just smells sweet. I wouldn't buy it again, and am not sure what to do with the rest of the bottle I have.",negative
Got as gift. Would never sent to anyone. Too dry. They are not good.  Too sweet and cheap tasting.,negative
I buy these from the grocery store all the time.  I use them in my daughter's lunch.They're exactly what I expected.,positive
Great price and lots of different varieties and they come in different sizes also,positive
These are NOT Andes mints and they are all stale. So now I'm stuck with 6 lbs. of useless stale chocolate. Utterly useless.,negative
This flavor worked great for Pina Colada Jell-O shots.,positive
I was misled in thinking this product was totally Organic.  It's not organic at all.,negative
"does not taste like bbq at all. it's more like coffee and chili powder. does not crisp up when baked, it comes out soggy.",negative
I know I know. Your gonna say crazy. I did. But I love cooking and love bacon in my fried potatoes in cast iron pan. I can't say enough good things. And gravy is the best. The possibilities are endless.,positive
Loved the pieces to this set! My 5 year old was so pleased with her cake and the fact that she had more Nightmare Before Christmas toys to play with!,positive
"I received this product free as part of a BzzAgent promotion. I use Lawry's Seasoned Salt religiously and also prefer their Taco seasoning mix to other brands, so my expectations were pretty high. It was very easy to prepare following the directions on the box. I used chicken breast pieces (about 2 lbs.) that I already had cut up on hand, and a couple of beaten eggs. You just wet the chicken in the egg and then dip in the crumbs, patting to make sure it all gets a good coating. I cooked mine on an ungreased cookie sheet. It came out great, crispy on both sides and delicious-smelling, and it did not stick to the pan at all. The chicken was flavorful and moist inside, and the kids agreed that it had just the right amount of spices. I really liked the ease of this mix and also the flavor and would definitely buy it. It's a nice change from our regular cornflake oven ""fried"" chicken.",positive
"I looked high and low at the grocery stores and could not find any Kitchen Bouquet! I was pleasantly surprised to find it here. As far as I'm concerned, no gravy is complete without Kitchen bouquet. I even remember my mother used it with roast beef.",positive
Yes red white and blue perfect,positive
This is my favorite flavor!  Wish it was sold in stores.  Will be purchasing more,positive
"I gave 2 stars because I did receive it fairly quick. However, compared to Better Body Foods, this coconut oil tastes like I’m eating Crisco! 🤢🤮🤮 I even had my daughter take it (like we do every day) and she about gagged. I took mine before she even woke up so she didn’t see my reaction. She’s used to taking it everyday, but this brand tastes terrible. And now I’m stuck with a huge 54FL OZ jar! 😔 I figured I’d try this brand bc of the great reviews and so many people recommending it and attaching the link to it to their pages. I really have no idea what to do with this HUGE jar now bc it’s not one that I’ll be ingesting that’s for sure. It definitely smells like coconut but I also, however, smell a hint of like a Crisco scent. Not sure why. I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this brand. Which is why I bought the 54oz jar. I guess I can try using it for other things I guess. Maybe I was just an unlucky one, I don’t know. I’m definitely bummed. Hope you all have better luck with yours!",negative
I’m very satisfied with the product not sweet at all it’s a good quick drink I take before I go to work. I would buy this product again.,positive
"These don’t taste exactly like chewy sour nerds, bu they’re very close. And at the value, it’s definitely worth it. I’ve bought two bags so far and the quality has been consistent. The only issue I have is they’re not as flavorful/sour as the original nerds brand. And sometimes there’s a slight difference in taste from nerd to nerd of the same color. But nothing super noticeable. Overall, worth it for the price.",positive
Great on the go snack.  No refrigeration needed.,positive
This coffee never disappoints!,positive
I haven’t gotten through all of the flavors yet. But the ones I have had been very good. I like that it’s a smaller size with a large variety so you know what you’d want in a large container. Completely sealed and no clumping of the product.,positive
"This stollen is the most delicious I have ever eaten!!  On a scale of 1 to 5, it is a +10 for sure!!The flavors meld together perfectly, the dough reminds me of brioche rolls and it is Christmasflavors all together in each mouthful!!  Awesome for sure!!  Plus when the package arrives it is perfectly packed and ready to eat.  Great customer service on all levels!!  Thank you!!👍👏😀",positive
I can feel my teeth rotting out.So 10/10!,positive
Very very good.  Ate them up too fast.,positive
tastes wonderful the only thing is they sign you up for more without you knowing,positive
"Ever since I discovered these on a long-ago trip to the UK, these have been one of my favorite cookies, and they are hard to find in the US - especially the plain oatmeal (without chocolate on top).  A bit pricy, but cheaper than a trip to England,  I guess.  Will order again",positive
"The cream part is my favorite and there is a lot of it, unfortunately they only come in a 4 pack. They were fresh.",positive
"This arrived quickly, all the nuts were actually whole and in good shape (often broken from other stores. They taste fresh and good.",positive
Gave me liquidy poops. Tastes quite alright,negative
"So happy I can get the Starbucks brand syrup to help in creating my favorite Starbucks iced coffee drink at home. Great flavor and convenient packaging. I love my Salted Caramel Mocha all year long and this and some mocha powder (I use Ghiradelli cocoa powder), sea salt and good espresso and it is just like going to Starbucks!",positive
I really enjoy the flavor these black peppercorns and they are packaged extremely well. Will buy @gain!,positive
"For something so healthy, this stuff is just incredible.  Just tried for first time today, INCREDIBLE substitute for milk in oats, also thoroughly enjoying in coffee.",positive
It is very nice and light.,positive
Always reliable Bisto,positive
"some where not whole, but for the most part whole, & were quality. I liked the individual pkgs. that were around100 calories each, but after reading calorie infor. these are around 10 calories each, so I know how many calories is consumed.",positive
"I do not like chocolate glaze on nuts, that's why I am always looking for cocoa dusted ones (less like candy and more intense cocoa flavor) and as far as cocoa dusted goes, those are the best on the market: so so good, very natural tasting, rich cocoa flavor and almonds melt in your mouth!!!Also not tons of sugar added, which is so hard to find in the US. I recommend them to all cocoa lovers who do not want ultra sweet. My go to snack every day now :)",positive
Great sugar free product! Tastes just like ketchup!,positive
Similar in taste to what I remember 50 years ago. Seems that quality may have suffered a tad but still a great treat memory realized,positive
Good with a chocolate coffee cream,positive
"Sent it to my boss as a condolence gift and she said they were beautiful. They came as buds and opened a few days later, which was nice as she could enjoy them longer.",positive
The package came (see photo) as a big chunk of chocolate that melted and stuck together. Disappointed.,negative
"Pirate's Booty, at least from what I remembered, was pretty tasty. Strong, bold taste.These 1-Ounce bags seems like a watered down version from what I'm used to.They are a light snack, and good to pack with your lunch. I would love for it to have a stronger cheddar taste, but apparently I would be wrong. My wife, and my 1 year old son loves them. They are light and melts in your mouth, so it's a very good grab and go type of snack.If you are like me, who like to be able to taste a strong cheddar flavor... I would not get these 1-ounce bags.But if you are like my wife, and my son who like soft and light taste of the cheddar, you would love these.I'm going to give it a 5 stars since my wife and son loves them.",positive
"Watery, crust tastes bad, as do the veggies.",negative
"I’ve only used two teas so far - the chai was lovely. The second tea was a run raisin and less delicious. I look forward to trying the rest. The cup works perfectly with the loose tea holder. The top doubles as a holder for the infuser, so no mess. It’s a very tight metal weave so the tea is a bit tough to wash out occasionally, but not a big burden.",positive
The recipe booklet with the Ice cream maker (the small makes in 25 minutes electric square kind)  we purchased suggested Heavy cream. Heavy Whipping Cream is NOT Heavy Cream. Makes a difference. In my town there was non to be found.Have used 2 bags & will be ordering 2 more!!,positive
This is the best tasting tea I have drunk in many many years,positive
Great to be able to find this on line. The pungent taste of the molasses is perfect for cooking.,positive
The product had been opened prior to shipping.The center top of lid was “popped” indicating the jar was opened.  There was no jar seal between the lid and jar.  The jar says to refrigerate after opening.  Contents are considered contaminated.,negative
"I'm south-east Asian and have been consuming fish sauce my for over 32 years. This product does not taste any different than most Asian brands I've had. Pretty disappointed. I was in search of Biblical ingredients and was amazed to find out Romans ate fish sauce too! Christ himself may have eaten garum as well which was the real reason why I wanted to try garum. At the end of the day it is what it is...fish sauce. There was nothing special about it. For about $8 a bottle, you can get equal quality fish sauce from brands like Red Boat.",negative
This one will never end you make delicious and lots Batches.This one is the best you can get for you Kefir projects.,positive
"I love other flavors of this brand, but this fig preserve is nothing more than sugar, and it's expensive! I didn't do the math and thought this was less expensive than the Dalmation - I think that's the name - brand that's really excellent but it turns out that Maman costs more! The other brand is infinitely better than this one. If you like sickeningly sugary liquids, you night like this.",negative
"Only recieved 6, paid for 12",negative
Arrived melted in one big clump,negative
Everyone loves chocolate kisses.,positive
This is the worst pizza sauce I’ve tried.  It’s so watery that I had to strain the liquid out.For the same price buy Whole Foods 365 brand organic pizza sauce.  100x better,negative
Arrived earlier than scheduled and frosty cold in a dry-ice cooler! Thanks for feeding my Snickers addiction!,positive
For a grain free cereal it is really delicious. Add on some berries and yum!!,positive
It tastes like yellow mustard... weird...,positive
Fresh nuts in a good preservative container at market price.  Just went nd bought a 2 lb. bag.,positive
"I have been buying Kathleen's cookies for well over 30 years - since before the company was called Tate's.  Long story, great cookie.  I think I was told that she makes the cookies to the original Toll House recipe (1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, butter, vanilla, ...) with one very simple change that makes the cookies thinner.While Kathleen (whom I still think of as a very young woman) has left the company, and the cookies have gotten smaller, they still taste the same.  Almost unheard of,  to keep product quality after big business takes over.  (So far, so good - maybe they found a butter substitute that tastes like butter.)  People will pay for quality,and these cookies are quality.",positive
"This is great chili and I always buy.  This time I received chicken soup, without the chicken, but that’s cool.  It’s a great time of year for soup.",positive
My particular box of tea did come from England. I had to wait 3 weeks for it to arrive and the seller's address is from England. I am very excited about this purchase. I simply love tea that is actually from England.,positive

"I love COSMOS snacks, but they’re hard to find in stock, even on the Asian site I frequent. My order was perfect and I hope to see these back in stock soon.",positive
"🙂: I have tried this noodle...and this kinda smells/tastes like konjac noodles. I guess this is a mixture of konjac and tofu. It breaks really easily.☹: I dunno if I am the only one getting loose poos...but I have been getting loose poos for 2 days..and have a little bit of belly ache.Overall, it is good.",negative
Hands down the BEST gummy bears I have ever had!,positive
"i liked the oyster flavor. i did not appreciate the way it talked to my mother, very saucy. but that was minor compared to the pleasure of oyster flavor.",positive
I think these taste so gross because of the bittersweet chocolate. Why chocolate liquor? Im upset that i can’t get my money back because i dont think ill ever eat these. Im disappointed. :/ I feel like the vanilla would have been so much better...,negative
Good deal well packaged and good product,positive
"This quinoa cooked up beautifully. While there were directions on how to cook it, they did not say whether you should wash it beforehand or if it had been pre-rinsed to remove the bitter saponins. I rinsed it in a fine sieve, just to be sure.I think it’s quite expensive, even for organic quinoa, but I gave it five stars for the quality.Culinary note: I always add a teaspoon, or a little less, of turmeric during cooking for added antioxidant power. After the quinoa has cooked, I add black pepper as it’s necessary to activate the benefits from the turmeric",positive
"She buys this stuff constantly.She says the 20g of protein ranks very high. And, it tastes way better than pea powder.",positive
4 cereal were open when I open the delivery box I expect a refund or replacement this deserves 0 stars,negative
"It's a good amount for the price, but it doesn't do as good of a job as the super fine black salt I usually use for my tofu",positive
I love ginger chews they are great for digestion. The best after holiday meals.,positive
"I will admit when I got these in the mail the first thing I thought was I got the wrong size; they looked so tiny! Then I looked back at the product page online and saw there wasn't a size selection. So I went to my fridge and grabbed a can of beer and sure enough it popped onto it. While it isn't bug season yet, I'm confident it will stop bees and flies, I DO NOT think it will stop nats.",positive
"Tasty cheese, like it on crackers especially.",positive
"Product is great, now all I need is for the Prime driver to read the delivery instructions.",positive
Quick shipping & great quality!,positive

great-tasting traditional humbugs. Recommend for anyone who likes English 'sweets'.,positive
"Damascus Rose Water by Govedic is made from distilled water through a boiling process so it is without any chemicals, preservatives, or alcohol. It is in a dark bottle to keep it from decomposing from direct sunlight. It has a fragrance and taste of fresh rose. I have used many other varieties of rose waters but this is the best quality I have experienced. I use it by sprinkling rose water on cold milk, yogurts, vanilla ice cream, floats, smoothies, and other sweet food items to add a pleasing aroma and flavor. I have also used it after shower by patting it on my face, neck, and back of my hands and found it very refreshing and relaxing. It seems to add moisture to my skin. I have also witnessed high-quality rose water being used in religious ceremonies. With its excellent aroma and taste, I give this rose water very high marks.",positive
Tastes exactly like the dressing our favourite Japanese restaurant uses!,positive
"This is some rancid tasting stuff.  It's light roast,  but it barely as any flavor.  More like ultra light.  It sure leaves a disgusting taste in your mouth too.  I had two cups and then gave it to my wife  to bring to work so her coworkers  wouldn't drink her good coffee anymore.",negative
"Stale candy, in a bag full of loose, individual, unpackaged Starburst, wasn't a winner for me. There were so many unpackaged Starburst (they're supposed to be packed in two-piece ""fun size"" or whatever wrappers) that I was a little concerned as to how this candy came to be bagged, to be honest.",negative
Good price. Reordered several times. Great for the breakfast.,positive
Perfect added taste for pasta salad,positive
We drink it all the time.,positive
The kind bar tastes so good. I love the honey and chocolate flavor!,positive
"This flour makes you look like a professional.  All the milk,  butter, eggs whatever additives you have used in the past are unnecessary with this flour. Great bread. Great flavor with just flour, water, yeast , salt and oil.",positive
The cake topper brought the whole cake together,positive
I absolutely love this candy.  I keep it in the freezer which helps stretch out the eating experience.,positive
The thickness of the noodles were perfect. Great for Pad Thai. We tried others that were just too thick and gummy. These has a much better texture.,positive
"Best way to add more flavor:Add 1 tsp of Orrington Farms Vegan Broth Base and Seasoning- Beef (Vegan Beef) flavoring to 2 cups of water in a small pot, bring to boil, add noodles, boil till tender about 3-4 mins, and then stir in the soy sauce flavor packet and boil another 30 secs to blend flavors. Pour in a bowl & enjoy!Other variations add 1/4 cup of the shredded super blend (marketside brand) with the tsp. of Beef “not” flavoring and then bring water to boil.Or you can add a variety of other veggies, vegan protein beef crumbles or chunks.",positive
Hello I have never had these..and they are so stinking good..especially with strawberries..,positive

"Yum,. love this flavor.",positive
"Most of us regular bakers have long ago switched from all-purpose to bread flour, and then incorporated some whole wheat flour as well.  But in search of a more European taste bread, I wanted to add in some rye flour as well. The results have been amazing, with a heartiness of flavor and texture.  (I use 3 parts white, 1 part whole wheat, and 1/2 part rye)  The rye flavor is noticeable but does not dominate.I love how this order arrived, in four smaller packages.  This allows me to properly store the bulk of the flour while only having a quarter of the flour in an opened state.",positive
My 2nd time purchasing these and no regrets! Great quality casings! You get a nice amount for the price.,positive
Keep it coming!,positive
I like these almonds they are fresh with no additives.,positive

"I originally found this dressing at (would you believe it!) Big Lots and LOVED it.  Couldn't find it there again, or anywhere else, so went to Amazon.  Had to buy 6 bottles and shipping was high because of weight so the cost per bottle was pricey but processing and shipping were quick and I gave some to my daughters and niece, so I ""spread the word"" and still have 3 bottles for myself.  So far, never disappointed with Amazon's performance.",positive
It's light and not thick but the taste is wonderful! You don't have to drench your breakfast in it to taste it like the commercial syrups.  Highly recommend!,positive
Very good product. I sleep as a baby after night cap,positive
"Our family has been hooked on Senseo coffee for about a year.  The dark roast is the best.  It's a nice, rich, full flavored cup of coffee!",positive

"I got this to add to my coffee in the morning, but mixed with hot coffee this tastes weird. The taste is just off and not good. It almost has a chemical taste to it. I do not recommend this and wish I could return it.",negative
"This is not really hot, just spicy enough to make a difference on things like eggs.  I, and all of my friends, really like this.",positive
Venom is by far the best tasting and most effective energy drink on the market. Their only competition for taste comes from the other flavors they sell. Red was my favorite flavor but then I tasted the orange cans which weren't orange flavor but tasted great. However Venom has done the impossible and put out a better tasting drink than the orange cans. These strawberry apple ones are amazing! It is without a doubt the best tasting energy drink on the market. The price to order online was high I believe but since I can't buy them anywhere else I am willing to pay the price. They were shipped extremely fast. Overall I am very satisfied.,positive
My tea blooms didn't look anything like the picture and there was no flavor.,negative

Highly recommend!7 months later... just had to follow up to say this plant is still thriving and is more beautiful than ever! It has sprouted about 12 new leaves since I purchased it in April.

"I can't believe I've just spent one and a half hours watching such a weak film. If there is only one film you have to miss, this is the one.Robert is a teenager whose father's died recently so he starts hanging out with some local anti-social teenagers and using drugs. All these make him subconsciously more violent and at last such subconsciousness explodes...The first thing is that I don't think I can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this film, not in any single character. If the director considers what I saw in the last couple of minutes as great ecstasy, I have to say that that's not even close.The use of cinematography is also not mature. Most of the time I couldn't see any facial expressions from the actors and I didn't feel the body language was sufficient enough to make an impact. Maybe the crew was just so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings. Everybody happy except the audience.The plot is particularly weak. There are a lot of unrelated scenes and talking which might be supposed to be related but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together, perhaps unless you're the one who wrote them.In the one and a half hour you may find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all other time there are just people walking, talking and moving. So I really can't comment on acting here.Nice choice of music in the last couple of minutes though. Maybe this is the only good thing.I have never given a film a 1 but this film certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch Scary Movies). This is a film about when a failed attempt to portray troubled teenagers meets extremely disturbed audience. Hope you fall into neither group.",negative
"I was so happy to notice this on my diet sheet from my doctor because, although delicious, the allowable rye bread made from wheat grown in northern Europe added too many pounds to my 5'2"" frame because it needed too much mayo, was pricey since it had to be shipped from New England because I had to buy 5 loaves at a time to make it worth shipping, and 5 loaves—although small—took up too much room in the freezer. Since these are flat, 7 packages—enough to qualify for free shipping elsewhere—take up very little room. I don't even notice that they're made from cauliflower which, btw, adds beneficial fiber. So diet-wise, these wraps are a keeper.I'm very happy to be able to have something resembling a sandwich again and make sure I don't run out although I purchase mine for much less from Walmart now and receive them in two days w/o any type of membership. Sorry, Amazon, but those of us with special dietary needs need every break we can get.",positive

I didn't buy this product online but from a 711. I occasionally get these as a snack but today the jerky was moldy. I have never seen this on a sealed product before. I can't buy these again now knowing this can happen. It's too pricey.,negative
I love the taste. I can’t drink coffee so this is a great substitute.,positive
"Great quality and quantity for the money. Good as is, but really best if ground down a bit in a mortar before use.",positive
"When SHTF, I have the means for cooking.  Do you?I'm happy to have this product for cooking when most won't have the option.  Sucks to be them.",positive
love it. It is stupid to require a certain # of words. I will not participate in your evaluations again,positive
"I did not enjoy these. I found them to be somewhat chalky. I left them in the break room at work and it took over 3 weeks for them to disappear, usually things are consumed in a week.",negative
"I was very pleased with the taste of the beans, and they are supposed to be healthy too. For the price, I think it's well worth it.",positive
I love this combination of nuts.  No salt.  Healthy.  Good bargain.,positive
I picked these pumps for the reason of having the rubber keep fresh covers. Torani syrup is Notorious for crystallizing if left uncovered is the caps would rectify that. The only issue I had was I used 12 ounce bottles. So what I did was cut one of the straws in half and it fit perfect. They work great and I will purchase more for future bottles.,positive
"It’s perfect! I LOVE pickle juice. Everyone in my house loves straight pickle juice. We normally go through a few jars of pickles a month, just for the juice. I’ve always specifically drank Mt. Olive but this is so good I can go through jars of pickles like a normal person! After we took the first sip we immediately ordered another jug! Don’t hesitate, it’s so good and worth it! (Just watch the price it fluctuates a lot)",positive
The powder was hard as a rock.,negative
"I previously had Guy Fieri coffee and found it to be delicious. While looking for his coffees, I found this variety pack that also includes Cake Boss coffee.  I’m very pleased with both coffee brands & like having lots of different flavors to chose.",positive
Love the flavor and tastes good. Others taste artificial this does not and I like the ingredients.,positive
This salsa is delicious!  I will be ordering again!,positive
"Nerds has been on fire this year with the new stuff they’ve been dropping. But the Clusters have been my favorite right from the start. But other people as well like this candy & it can be difficult to find them in stores. The packaging was on point when it arrived, stacked neatly in the box with no issues. All in all, if your wanting a great candy dropped to your doorstep. Highly recommend",positive
"When I saw 16 ounces, I didn't expect quite that large a bag, but I'm definitely not complaining! I've used Red Raspberry Leaf Tea before, and I absolutely adore it. It tasted exactly as I remembered and has really helped some of my health issues. My package arrived about 3 days before I expected it, which was a huge plus. I am more than happy with the results and the cost was very affordable, especially considering how much some of my local health food stores mark up their tea. Well worth it! I would recommend this product and company to anyone interested in giving it a try.",positive
Stale horrible taste waste of money and no refund,negative
Great product just like all of their other flavors.,positive
"Little hair found in tray throughout layers of cookies AFTER I had eaten one. Cookie was crumbly, sweet, not buttery. Stick to the best taste and quality, buy Walkers and not this lack-of-quality-control company. Never again ANYTHING from Back to Nature.",negative
Makes the best barbecued pork easey,positive
I really like the taste of this tea compared to others. It always seems fresh to the last bag.,positive
Same as Spicy review.,positive

Arrived timely and is delicious.,positive
Extremely happy that product was so fresh!,positive

This keto granola tastes absolutely amazing!!!,positive
This is the best coffee I have ever had. It is the perfect roast. A huge shout out to Amazon for having this product and not having to go to Canada when I want some Tim Hortons!,positive

"I read some of the reviews and I have to say the negative ones were just a TAD OFF! I am PLEASED with my order from start to finish!You cannot always find mild flavored beef jerky. It is always marinated with spices that can and over time bother the lining  of your digestive system from your esophagus to your stomach. For those health-conscious people I would think (and am surprised that it is not a big deal) it a big deal to keep your inside as healthy as your outside?  NO? And, with that said - it is very hard to find Beef Jerky (protein source) such as purchasing/purchased that does not agitate your upper digestive lining. . . . Que Slim Jim Mild - I was LUCKY to find this vendor that had MILD!!! I am happy that those that were dissatisfied fed their unwanted Slim Jim Milds to their dogs. At least they were kind to their pet's digestive lining!As for the date of order to the date of received - it was a matter of a few days. So - for the person that had the Lewis and Clark Delivery - I am sure that this was an isolated incident and/or issue - not my place to speak - But it is my place to speak as a satisfied customer that is happy for this vendor and the great service that it provided to me personally for having MILD BEEF JERKY available AND GREAT MAILING SERVICE!!! I THANK YOU! xo",positive
"I have been eating these yummy treats for over a month now since purchased. Here are the good, the bad, and the verdict.THE GOOD- Very tasty. I normally don't like raisen but these are actually very tangy and sweet which is much better in my opinion than the ones that are super sweet- Fresh and no funny smell when first opened- I store them in a tight glass container in my pantries away from light- Good quality and value- I have used them in plain yogurt and it is delicious 😁THE BAD- Nothing after over a month of useTHE VERDICT:Will re-purchase",positive
I ordered this to times and taste very good but on the second Order they delivered to the wrong place,positive
The item arrived smashed in the box making it no longer Big Texas Cinnamon rolls.  They were very stale and dried out and sold them 2 months before which I was never informed of.  Make sure to ask questions and read reviews.,negative
"I had to go on a low FODmap diet, and have been following it for about a year. One thing I missed more than anything was the onions and garlic. Most meals feel so incomplete without these flavors.Luckily, I found an ad for this and began using it in almost everything, from soups, spaghetti-meat sauces, and roasted veggies, to replacing just a bit of my normal olive oil in my Greek dressings for salads. A little does go a long way, if you're not cooking with it.I tend to restock every month or two, it won't break the bank, and is EBT approved, so even those on a budget can still have a flavorful low FODmap diet.",positive
It had all the beans and spices that they always had it is just way over priced in my opinion,positive
Taste better than reel chikum,positive
I gave these to my husband for stocking stuffers and he has tried everyone of them and has really enjoyed the flavor of each. They’re all very different and that’s what I was looking for. It’s nice to have a change and try new things and he is really enjoying these flavors,positive
I have found many uses for this product.  It is lighter and healthier than regular flour and makes a great substitute in batters and breading.  It also is great when making potato cakes and sweet potato cakes.,positive
My favorite! Please come back in stock. I’ve tried others on Amazon and there’s no comparison. This one is perfect.,positive
LOVE these! The caramel flavor is spot on I usually just drink these straight but sometimes I even add them to my coffee as creamer. So yummy!,positive
Grew up on milk straight from the cow!!!!!! This tastes just like it. Grocery store milk does not have the same flavor which is why a few reviews say it's 'barn yardy'. Guess it depends what you grew up on. Got this for my pantry when I run out of store milk in the winter and can't get to town. Will definitely reorder.,positive
These little packs of miso soup are great for work.  I keep them in my desk and when I get hungry just fill it with hot water in the break room.  They taste just like the soup you get in Japanese restaurants.  I have bought these multiple times and will continue to do so.  We always keep them around the house for upset tummies too.,positive
"Very expensive for size, but it is sodium free and does taste great",positive
Like the New England brand . Good coffee. Priced right,positive
"the bananas were black and bruised, for the higher price I paid for organic bananas, I expected bananas.The avacados were bad too.",negative

"I expected to receive Lucini Extra Virgin Select Olive Oil grown and bottled in Italy, however the product I received was grown in the Andes and bottled in Argentina (See picture).",negative
"Clearly, I did not receive the correct product. It was supposed to come with the “golden flavor egg”. The plain version isn’t appetizing and the sick person I sent it to won’t be eating it. I wish I could return it. So expensive, and falsely advertised. It’s not sold in stores near her. It would have been such a nice surprise to receive her favorite comfort food during an illness.",negative
This product has fabulous flavor and is my favorite to add into protein shakes.,positive
"These are delicious. I have them with milk for breakfast or eat them dry from a mug as a snack. Not too sweet, just right.",positive
"Very cute, I made a donut tower and placed it right on top.",positive
"I miss the Swiss Chalet restaurants, especially the dipping sauce. A friend told me about this and I have ordered twice. It has the same taste as the sauce without as much salt. We use it on everything and love it!",positive
I was a little hesitant getting these because of the reviews. But I decided to try anyway. Oh my God these were very delicious! They taste just like doughnuts! The cinnamon donuts taste like coffee cake Dunkin donuts and the chocolate ones like cake doughnuts And the birthday cake doughnuts were so moist! My favourite was the chocolate. I am so glad I bought these I will definitely be buying more. My kids who are very picky love them. There are alot for 50 dollars is a good price. Now I can have a doughnut without the sugar and unhealthy ingredients. These were also very filling as one filled me up for a few hours. Very satisfying thank you for making these. God bless!,positive
everyone loves Cheetos.,positive
Lovely! Tasty and fresh. Easy to use. Love this brand.,positive
"I was entirely unfamiliar with this k cup brand. After my first few cups wished I'd ordered a lot more while it was on sale. This was one of the better k cups I've tried, a very decent cup of coffee, far superior to many better known brands.",positive
Delicious tea.  Can tell its age by its smoothness.,positive
One of the best flavored salts. Put is in your fries or meat and the result will be amazing. No more seasoning need,positive
Did not taste like the ones with shells. No flavor and taste awful chewy did not eeturn threw away. Not worth task of  returning,negative
I really liked the taste. My husband not as much as me. We both agree that we wish they were bigger and more filling.,positive
I give 2 stars because my LO loves the flavors but 6 of them were broken when they arrived.,negative
"I’ve tried kickass and bear claw. All are amazing, but I’d say this is probably my favorite. Sooo good, smells AMAZING, fresh, no bitter after taste, smooth, great flavor depth. Im breastfeeding and it’s hard keeping myself down to two cups a day!",positive
A brand name I can trust it is what it says it is my doctor says you can trust it. Thank you Frontier for being honest and organic.,positive
Great product that tastes like authentic South African droewers. Product is much nicer then the biltong from the same brand.,positive
"I love tonic water both with and without alcohol. I've tried many brands over the years. This ""American"" tonic water does not appeal to me at all. It is bitter and soapy tasting. There are subtle differences in flavor between various brands. None are as off-the-charts unpleasant. The taste is bitter and medicinal. It left an aftertaste in my mouth long after I completed my taste test.If you like traditional tonic water, I'm sure you won't like this. Perhaps there are people who prefer the astringent bitterness of this product. Not me.",negative
Perfectly as discribed.. chicken and dumplings..,positive
"Great flavor, cheaper then going to Starbucks plus at Walmart, they cost $3.49 in Kansas.  So I would say price and flavor is a GO on Amazon",positive
Great for anyone on keto. I use it for everything!,positive
There was absolutely no comparison to the pocture shown and the one I received. It was a great disappointment and i will never order from them again.,negative
"I’m pretty disappointed by this purchase. I couldn’t find dum dums at any of my local stores and I had a big craving for them. I was happy to see Amazon had a wide variety of options. I went with this seller because I didn’t want a boatload of lollipops. Just enough to cure my craving.They arrived fine and were packaged well. My issue is there wasn’t much of a variety. Both my packs got mostly sour apple, and cherry. There was only one orange, which is so disappointing cause that’s one of my favorite flavors. I just wish they had more variety and didn’t repeat flavors so much.I guess for the price it’s ok but I’d have to try another order before saying if it’s a great deal or not. Maybe I just got a bad batch that didn’t happen to have much variety. Once we work our way through all these cherry and sour apples, I’ll order more and hope we get better flavors",negative
I surprised my aunt and she LOVED it! She said it was beautiful and it really made her happy.,positive
Very pleased with how well it grinds. The taste is amazing and the price was very good!,positive
These are your classic frosted mini wheats. Crunchy and sweet. They are very fresh. You get 4 18 ounce boxes. The boxes I received in August 2021 expire in July 2022.,positive

"I have been eating Tahiti since growing up in the middle East as a little girl many years ago. This hands down, has quickly become my favorite Tahini! I absolutely love it, and highly recommend!",positive
This is my favorite morning drink any and every day of the year. A little too expensive online but sometimes retailers in the area are sold out..,positive
"You get more value for the money with this gelatin. I don't think I'll ever go back to the other one I was taking. Get more in this container and it cost less, but I get the same benefits. So it's a win-win for me.",positive
"Didn’t dislike anything.  Fantastic flavor.  Usually eat rice with something else, but will probably eat this rice alone with butter and turmeric.",positive
"Wanted to try something different, this was it! Love the low acidic level so I can enjoy the fresh brewed taste and no stomach issues! Very smooth, medium blend does not lack flavor at all. Good buy for the money, I will buy again.",positive
My grandson has so many allergies - so these are a great addition to his allergy free food list &  these can be served in so many waysThey are a little bland but he enjoys them ( age 2 & 1/2),positive
Very good tasting! Will buy them again.,positive
After receiving the coffee maker as a gift I was very happy to find this coffee. It is very nice and perfect for one cup.,positive
2 boxes came today and I was looking forward to this treat.  Both boxes where fine but bags inside where crushed.  @ll very small pieces.,negative
Quick shipping and great prices on organic spices.,positive
Great for avocado toast and grilled cheese. I also use as hamburger buns. Much tastier than the plan version.,positive
Nice to have when you're hungry and want something hot.,positive
"yummy chocolate taste, I love them nice and cold! I did find they are cheaper in Sams Club.",positive
"My husband and I love parmesan crisps! But what we especially love about these is the size! The other ones we've bought from the store are tiny little circles, but these are sturdy, and much bigger! Why is that good? Because you have to try these with avocado on top!! It's amazing! Or thinly sliced apples! But these are perfectly addicting without any toppings - it's just fun to play with different pairings. Oh yeah - and try these on your next cheese spread for an afternoon with some wine!",positive
So yummy . We always put it in our Prosecco and it is so yummy .,positive
"Love these and love the price! My son is obsessed with Izze but I have a hard time finding them in stores, and when I do, it’s for more then I paid for these. It made his day when this package showed up",positive
"Excellent value. Perfect flavor for steak, chicken, pork.etc.",positive
"I had seen online ads about JAVY for a while. When I found it being sold here I decided to try a bottle because $16 & Prime shipping was too good to pass up. It's good. Really good. I'm not sure what I was expecting but it surpassed those expectations anyway.I've only tried it with cold whole milk so far but I look forward to experimenting with other liquids both hot and cold. Like chocolate milk! It mixes near instantly with cold liquid so I'm sure hot or warmed wont be a problem at all.Having only tried it one way I can say it was very pleasant. Like drinking chocolate milk, only coffee flavored, if that makes sense. Coffee flavor was great, not burned or synthetic tasting like I thought it might end up being. Not bitter or acidic either making it very easy to gulp down (when I'm in a hurry) or casually sip before work.And finally the caffeine. It works and works well. I wager that I drink about 150~200mg of caffeine when I drink coffee. I get up at nearly 5am for work and this has offered an interesting alternative to pre-setting the coffee pot or stopping somewhere on the way to work or cracking an energy drink.All this to say, I'll admit it, I'm impressed.",positive
Very good! Next order going out!,positive
Staying away from sugar can be hard.. I love that I can take a few with me when going out of town...,positive
All in all happy,positive
"These just taste bad. Pink and red both taste like cough syrup. White is mint, which is weird given that the rest are fruit flavors. I like banana, but this one tastes weird. Honestly only the blue and white are edible.",negative
"So, I have fallen in love with these drinks! When I realized I could order one flavor in bulk...I was thrilled!(Mango is my favorite) Unfortunately, these arrived yesterday and when I opened one(following morning) I was so disappointed. Tasted like it had gone bad. Expiration date isn't until Oct. 7, 2017. Opened up a second one and also had same rotten taste. Didn't give a one because the ones I have bought in the store are delicious! So wish this would have worked out.",negative
I did not like the taste of this coffee. Was very disappointed,negative
I love the flavor of this product in my shakes and for baking 🍪!  I have been dealing with this local seller for a long time and they are always a pleasure to work with and helpful if any issues occur. My bag was in perfect condition.,positive
The popcorn had a stale flavor,negative

"The Candy was perfect. Great throwback to the 80s. Reminder of years past, when we were young and life was easy.  Little confused about the Zots tho....those were around in the 70s",positive
I love this Peets coffee as well as the Maj. Dickinson. I do wish they were a more reasonable price.....But great coffee.,positive
"I am strict keto and this is such a great find! 2 net carbs per serving is perfect for my daily macros and it keeps me full until lunch! The flavors and textures are spot on, delisicous  and very pleasing. I will be buying from now on!",positive
"I put this S#&% on everything! It's an especially good dry rub for steaks and red meat. I'm the kinda person who usually makes my own dry rubs but once I tried this it was over. Just give it a chance and be generous with the rub, it won't be too sweet or salty. Perfect Balance.",positive
I bought these instead of shelled peanuts to boil.  It seems Indians have lots of recipes using peanuts like a vegetable.  I soaked them for hours then pressure cooked them.  Wow. I'll buy more for sure.  But this bag will last several months.,positive
Very tasty as always!,positive
One star is generous. Ordered these for valentine for my wife.  My wife was extremely disappointed.  They were small and dieing. My wife just through right away.  If you care about the individual you are ordering for do not use this company.,negative
I haven't yet tried it. But one of the pack was open on arrival. I'm highly disappointed!,negative
"Always a good product; however, one of the containers leaked all the contents in transit. I discarded it so that I do not get food poisoning. It smelled.",negative
Finally a bold decaf for the Keurig!  Strong enough to satisfy my need even in the large cup.,positive
"This is the Best! I use it in soups, casseroles, as well as marinading of meats. It gives a wonderful smokey flavor.",positive
Best price per cup that I’ve seen,positive
I have had Cattaneo Bros Jerky my entire life and have ordered it from Amazon many times. The most recent order was wrong. It was like the Jerky was sitting in the sun or something. The flavor was off and even the color as you can tell by the picture was grey. Very disappointing. There was no return or replacement option for this Jerky either. Probably should just order direct through Cattaneo Bros online but the ease of Amazon makes this appealing. Hope I don't ever get jerky like this again not at 30 dollars a bag.,negative
"Great for gingerbread houses or just nibbling. Soft enough to slice and use cross sections to creat ultra-mini “starlight mint” details in gingerbread houses. We also used them on chimneys, etc. see photosWill definitely purchase again next Christmas",positive
It’s false advertising the recipe Has changed and I wanted the old one.,negative
This is my husbands favorite flavor for the holiday season,positive
We love using this on pizza. So good!,positive
This product is amazing it has such a good flavor and texture. I use it in my vanilla yogurt every morning when I get home from work,positive
"These are nasty tasting chips. I realize they’re suppose to be healthy, but these are honestly disgusting.",negative
"Buy cheaper at Costco, but tastes DELICIOUS - best flavor enhancer for Chicken EVER.",positive
This is my favorite coffee but I noticed that it arrived from a 3rd party- I was so desperate for my Hawaii fix that I ordered anyway - but it must’ve been an old package of coffee bc the taste was old and the box was damaged ….,negative
These bully stick always arrives on time and our dog is so happy!,positive
Delivery was on time however the fruit has gone bad! This was supposed to be a Birthday gift for my dad...i wanted to send him something nice especially this time since its his first Birthday without my mom. Was hoping to put a smile on his face. So embarrassing! Waste of money...and i dont even know how to contact to complain about...disappointed you get what you pay for!,negative
"Great spread; I’m not a vegan, just liked this better than regular mayonnaise.  Unfortunately, my local store (Newtonville, MA) that Trader Joe has now discontinued it.",positive
This spicy (but not knock your socks off hot!!) has been delicious in everything we've used it with. The lemon overtones make it a great addition to my green tea. My husband makes a spicy honey chicken dish that this was on point for. For something a little different we used the BeeStung honey with homemade biscuits and it was a great new twist on an old favorite. Delievery was super fast and customer service is excellent. 10/10 highly recommend.,positive
This is just the product you need for making good vegan scrambled eggs. Remember it is salt. And you added at the end of the cooking process in order to get that egg taste.,positive
"My kids love these! Just make sure to keep away from your pets. Dogs can't have  Xylitol . So of you have young kids like myself, make sure they aren't feeding it to their pup. Otherwise great for my kids and they taste pretty good.",positive
Great substitute for those on salt restrictions.,positive

Very good actually.,positive
Delicious and arrived quickly.,positive
"I maintain two candy dishes in my house: one near the front door and one near the rear door so anyone coming or going can grab a mint.  The thing is these particular mints retain their flavor and color for a very long time hence the large sized bag.  Been buying these Starlights for years and have always been pleased.Good product, good price, well packaged, fast delivery.  What's not to like?",positive
"I really enjoyed the taste! I also like how low calorie it was because I can drink hot chocolate 10xs a day so that was guilt free.I also love that its a probiotic so I would sip it infront of my students, what a fun way to fight off germs.",positive
I love these cookies and the tin but my tin was beat up pretty bad 👎second order tin destroyed maybe you think its cute or maybe its Amazon,positive

"I love these walkers mince pies to share with friends for the holidays , but they were packaged very poorly with no protection and all pies are crushed and broken into pieces…and no way to return them or get a refund.  If I could give zero stars I would",negative
I love making Meso soup with my own twists. I add spinach and a few noodles. I only use 1 pod or nest of these noodles for a whole pot and am careful to add at the end so they don’t overcook. These noodles have a great chewy texture that goes so well in the soup. I add a touch of wasabi paste to bring a little heat and my family loves it. I like that you can reseal the bag for future use.,positive
Works but there's usually a very vanilla scent and I don't have it in this product. I'm still using it because money wan spent for it.,positive
It’s been advertised as a syrup but in reality it’s a molasses and it doesn’t taste like the flavor it been sold under,negative
Yummy! Roasted them in the oven. They came perfectly packaged and ripe for the eating.,positive
"this stuff makes a great cup, just a bit different,nice change,its got that chicory which is like a new orleans deal,its great with a scoop a vanilla ice cream and shot ahalf n half",positive

"Excellent seasoning for marinating especially steak, I will continue to purchase.",positive
"It took me a while to find a non dairy cheese I love, either the texture was weird or it had a very strange aftertaste. However Violife changed that! This is my favorite plant based cheese! It taste like real cheese without the cholesterol and guilt lol",positive
Favorite organic coffee!!!,positive
Love the taste and smell of the tea,positive
"I ate these in place of potato chips, they were not only lower in calories they were quite satisfying, in my opinion even better then chips. They really are the Greatest Snack ever!!!",positive
"Manuka Honey  is always GREAT,  and I always keep it handy around the house if I feel a cold coming on, or even for heart burn.",positive

"Poor Ivy: Though to the manner born, she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel (Richard Ney). As the movie is set in the 20s or 30s, when rigid Victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges, this uncertain status vexes her unduly. The Gretorexes (for so they are called) don't know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy-dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born middle-aged), she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him. Luckily, one of the beaux she still strings along (Patric Knowles) is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison, with which she bids her hubby farewell. The fact that it implicates Knowles doesn't phase her a bit, even as the hours trickle by until he should be hanged by the neck until dead. The turning of the plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (the redoubtable Lucile Watson); and Knowles' loyal housekeeper (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama; Fontaine's luminous face supplies the rest.",positive
Great find !!!! Wonderful product. Is exactly as advertised and very prompt service. Will purchase from them again.,positive
I thought I was ordering “a case” of Spam.That’s what I was shopping for.I must have misunderstood  along the way.,negative
"I have noticed over the years how different honey taste depending on what flowers the honey bees have access too.This bottle of white honey has a very different taste then honey I have bought in Hawaii, which was one of my favorites,and had a macadamia nut taste, that was expensive for a very small amount.This Wholesome honey has a flowery berry taste to me, and I do like it allot.This comes in a easy to use squeeze bottle. I hope the plastic is non-gmo!Organic, No,Pesticides, etc. The wild flowers for this honey are grown in a remote forest in Mexico, and Brazil.I usually buy the raw organic dark honey from trader joe's. That honey taste good, but I have to say,This white honey is awesome, and I really like it, but its pricey, but not as much as the honey in Hawaii!Honey is the oldest natural sweetener, with allot minerals depending on the flowers. I do not know what flowers are in this honey,But it says , wild flowers, organic.I mainly use honey in my organic tea.I can taste the difference using this honey in my tea, and I like it better then what I usually use.",positive
Needed some for dinner the following night and didn't want to go to the grocery store.,positive

"I have a cup of Bigelow Lemon Lift tea every morning. So when Target stopped carrying it, I turned to Amazon to get my tea. The price was a little more than what I was paying but so much less than what the grocery store charges. I just love Amazon and my prime account. I had the tea in two days I ordered 2! I have shared this tea with so many of my friends and once they taste it they are hooked too!",positive
Yummy!! Tastes just like I remember from Hawaii!!!,positive
Iv had this problem time and time again ordering online it feels lk the product given is old or expired it’s always extremely dry and almost hard,negative
Misleading advert. I thought these would be simply cherry. However this company actual makes all the roll ups with APPLE as the main ingredient and oranges listed twice! Its a dehydrated fruit cocktail which would be fine if I wasn't allergic to both apples and oranges. Very upsetting. Super misleading.,negative
Just what we wanted for my son’s birthday cake. It came out so beautiful with the cake topper,positive
This is a good value for this size. Tastes great!,positive
"I love this product! It's better than soda,and all the flavors are great! I really like the Black Cherry and Black Raspberry. My son just tried it for the first time,and wanted to know where he could get some! I'm actually getting him a few cases for Christmas. After that, he can subscribe to Amazon and get his own!",positive
There was a great selection and very fresh.  We have enjoyed them very much.  The second order will cost us $4 more.,positive
So many different flavors and for the price you can't beat it,positive
the product was a little pricy,positive
"Cooks up super easy and has a very authentic restaurant Miso soup taste, Add some green onions and it's perfect! Makes a TON of soup",positive
Great taste soft cookie.,positive
"This is my all time favorite candy! It is so tasty and I was so impressed with how fresh it was. Usually when you get it in a candy store, it is stale  and hard. This bag was fresh and soft and smells and tastes perfect! I am giving 2 lbs as a gift to my sister, who also loves it, giving a lb to my mom, and keeping one for my household to eat now, and one for in the freezer for later! Highly recommend!",positive
Toast every morning,positive
"First, they are a small business. Second, I really enjoyed their fast shipping and the note they left me. Last, everything was fresh and I even got a little surprise in my order. Good people!",positive
Great taste.  I wish there was a tad more vanilla flavor,positive
Good candy bars.  Glad to find them on the internet as I can't find them in local stores.,positive
Excellent delivery! Great product.,positive
"These have really gone downhill.  The words on half of the hearts are crooked, too faint to read, or almost invisible.  Will not be buying these again.",negative
I like Cheerios but so does my granddaughter so if I want any I have to go over to her home to eat them.,positive
It got broken to the post office and was reurned. I's still expecting your reaction,negative
"I am so in love with these cookies, it's such an amazing start to the day. They are chucked full of great ingredients that get you started on your way. Even take on your way out. My favorite is the Cranberry Nut.",positive
Loved it in the recipe for Nutella Cookies.,positive
For what I paid for this it’s not worth it some of the candy was rock hard and all the cracker products were all broken like they had been smashed I don’t know how many times we didn’t even get all the things it says DONT BUY NOT WORTH It WORST thing I have ever bought!,negative
"I really have enjoyed this almond butter so far. It’s such a rich and powerful almond flavor, with a natural sweetness that nothing else really needed added in the first place! Do keep in mind it does separate a bit easily, but this is because it was made without any major emulsifiers, which most conventional grocery brands will have added - not necessarily harmful, but at the same time not necessary either. Since it is more unroasted almonds, I do recommend trying to stick to smaller quantities of it as to avoid any stomach aches that you may otherwise have occur if you’re ever eating a large amount of tree nuts like almonds, but An almond butter sandwich works wonders!",positive
"My sister's cat is one fussy eater.  He's an olster who I guess doesn't have the keenest sense of smell any more so he wasn't eating much.  We discovered that putting just a tiny pinch of this on top of his food (it has a very PUNGENT fish odor) makes him eat like a teenage boy.  He's put some weight back on and is so much healthier now that he's eating properly.  I know that's not the intended use of this stuff, but I also heard people feed it to their cats as a treat.  I originally bought it to make dashi and had tons left over so I gave some to my sis and it worked like magic.",positive
The thickness makes it perfect for swallowing vitamins! The flavor is delicious and non acidic! It’s mildly sweet and not bitter. Love it!,positive
"Holy heck what a great sauce. Just hot enough (we bought the ""hot""), vinegar and citrus-forward. If you like vinegar you'll love this sauce. No added sugar! .5g sugar per serving! It's perfectly bright and lovely.We'll be buying more from now on.",positive
"I thought about returning it, but it was a theme for a Christmas gift so I ended up giving it to the person anyways and apologized and told them to feel free to throw it away. Both boxes were completely destroyed.",negative
Used as a side dish.,positive
I love all the other products but these were disappointing to me.,negative
Perfect fluff,positive
Best tasting tea..,positive
Refreshing. Keep drinking it guy. Your lady will come back to you for more.,positive

its soda. mint.,positive
This is good decaf coffee.....and that is not easy to find.,positive
"Delicious, natural tasting tomatoes.",positive
"Smells like Freedom. Tastes like Victory...... that was all it took to give it a try.  My order came 5 days late and I was disappointed.  There’s nothing special about this coffee at all - totally underwhelming.  Warrior Select K-cup is branded as Med/dark but it has a very mild flavor....on par with any Donut Shop style K-cup.  I’ll stick with Rev or Joe’s Tall, Dark, and Handsome.",negative
Arrived quickly. Nice ziplock bag to keep it fresh. Tastes great.,positive
"I tried the strawberry, mango and pineapple varieties. The strawberries are overall the best based on the fact that they’re bite size portions.  Mango came second even some pieces are a little big but the flavor was excellent. Even the pineapple was good altho some of the larger pieces were a little too chewy - probably due to the section of the pineapple that was used. The chocolate however was awesome!!! They might seem pricey but you get 4 decent sized bags so the cost is comparable to Brookside",positive
"I would normally not like cinnamon flavored coffee... I got this for my mother who would love it. I tried it and WOW!  It's smooth, rich, darker roast with a hint of cinnamon is outstanding. Always fresh!",positive
Hickory Farms delivers as always,positive
"Great tasting baguette. It feels like freshly baked and stay fresh fir days after. I could not get enough of it as my supplier ran out on me for two weeks.Because it’s an import, supply may be a problem. So stock up when you can and enjoy this great tasting bread; flavorful, crusty and satisfying.",positive
"I like this yogurt. The only reason it is thin is because it is not Greek yogurt. Please consider that fact. It was smooth, not too sugary. I love it",positive
Fresh flavor - supple and damn spicey.#Love.,positive
"The idea behind this is nice, a quick breakfast item.  It is fun and easy, yes.  Add water, stir, eat.Unfortunately, it is all plastic.  If you are having one of these daily, you are part of the problem.  The label is not even recyclable.  Why not sell the powder/mix and let people get their own reusable containers?  The amount of waste these generate is unbelievable.The ingredients are merely okay.  I would not call them good or healthy.  There is some healthy stuff in here, balanced out by some kind of gross, nasty stuff, ""non-GMO"" or not.And finally, the price.  My god, the price.  What kind of person wants to spend $5 for 130 calories?  This is absolutely insane.  Go to the grocery store and buy some berries or something.  Make your own food.  Don't finance this environment-destroying cash grab.Sorry to be dramatic, but this is kind of a shocking product.  It's a nice idea gone so totally wrong that one cannot help but almost appreciate the bizzarity of American culture and how this embodies it.",negative
I have ordered this brand of k-cups before so was very disappointed with the film these leave in every cup.  I've already used several so too late to send back but just an fyi to others.,negative
These are a tasty snack,positive
"My favorite flavor, have bought a lot more than one small box...",positive
"My favorite green tea by a mile.  Fruity, never bitter.",positive
"Cutting down on Splenda, due to sensitivity & migraines, to 2 packets (or less) a day seemed impossible before finding this sweetener. We are ABSOLUTE TEA ADDICTS! Hot. Cold. Ice cream. Cookies, etc. We had a the hardest time finding sweeteners which neither altered teas delicate flavor nor made it overtly bitter. To our blissful surprise this sweetener, has a far more subtle flavor than either honey or agave, and imparts zero bitterness. And this sweetener offers the perfect smooth sweetness with (or without) just the tiniest bit of Splenda. Best of all, it sweetens using a water base rather than using alcohol (imparted a taste we noticed even with just a single drop) or glycerin (messy bottles)! I just came back here to order a few more for our household & to pass on the words, ""We hope they never stop making this product"". Amazing price, awesome product, holy delicious tea time, Batman!",positive
One of my husbands favorite dishes and easy to prepare.  Spicy but not hot spicy.,positive
Taste so close to lucky charms!!! An amazing alternative,positive
This is my favorite breakfast item and its not stocked in Publix stores in FLa.,positive
"These cherries taste great, and the reusable jar is beautiful.  I use them in cocktails and fizzy water. It's hard to not eat them straight out of the jar!",positive
"This is the second ""Best"" of Thailand"" product I purchased. Unfortunately I bought both at the same time, thinking the quality would be excellent. I was wrong. It's terrible. Thick, bland, blah.",negative
We've been getting these through subscribe and save for over a year.  We love them.  The portion size is perfect for grab and go.  The nuts are always fresh and taste good.  The amount of salt is perfect.  We will keep ordering them.,positive
"Love it , it wasn’t open nice and organize !!",positive
Great flower and great price this cheese is my favorite 😍 😋,positive
I ordered original flavor and got hot and spicy. I did not realize until opened and made one.,negative
These are amazing I love them and great little pick me up while at work,positive
I’m a vegan and have had alternatives before. The taste is awful and this is coming from someone who isn’t picky at all. The cooking measurement proportion also was not successful? It could have been on my end but I’d look into another product if I were you.,negative
We have this in our local grocery store here in San Antonio.  Was visiting friends in NC and we were going to make ribs.  Well Amazon to the rescue to get the rib rub we wanted.  It was delivered timely and everyone loved the ribs.,positive
What's not to love about La Croix? Just check the price to make sure it is comparable or even less than in the store.,positive
"Perfect coffee every single time. No mess, quick and very convenient. Love the dark roast. Normally take on holidays 'coz I cannot stand the 'house' coffee",positive
I need a refund. I could smell the mold before I even opened it. Horrible!Update: I still haven't heard from anyone regarding a refund for my product. Horrible!,negative
"Mirin is needed in almost all Asian cooking. This Kikkoman brand is one of the best made in Japan. This brand in my local Asian store went up in price up to the ceiling. A 10 oz bottle is selling over $10.  I use 1 oz for every stir fry or hot pot dish for 3 in my family. I thought of making my own at home combining rice, water, Sake and sugar and store and wait for 2 weeks. But just the cost of Sake is more than this 60oz bottle of Mirin and I don't have to wait 2 weeks. This 60oz bottle is definitely a bargain and I think the price will go up soon so buy now.",positive
"Came on time, sturdy, was able to stick inside cake without toppling.",positive
"I was looking for Terry's Chocolate Oranges to give as gifts and found these Brach's ones, at an excellent price. I've always enjoyed Brach's candy and decided to give them a try. They arrived promptly and in good condition, with the twelve individually boxed oranges packed into a 12-pack box and that nestled in a larger box with air-pillow padding.Curious to see if I had made a good buy, I opened one to try for myself. I find them to be comparable to Terry's in every way -- size, look, flavor (creamy milk chocolate with a sufficiently prominent orange taste).Now I'm just hoping I can think of at least eleven people to give one, so that I don't wind up eating all the extras myself.",positive
"If you like the texture of cream of wheat, you will likely enjoy this as a replacement. I noticed a slight coconut flavor to the “plain” (from the coconut flour) the first time I tried it. I noticed it less the second time. I prepared it with butter and used a brown erythritol to sweeten and found it to be a really good keto version of cream of wheat.",positive
"Absolutely delicious, will definitely buy again!",positive
Love this coffee. Smooth low acidity good flavor ! Will continue to buy it.,positive
"Hard to find in stores so I am thrilled to be able to buy on line, love to make European cookies. Will order again",positive
I like it very much. I am planning to buy the Cinnamon creamed honey,positive
Love this coffee. Taste great.,positive
"Fresh and flavorful. These are great for tea, but too much on the small side if you are looking to stud a ham.",positive
"It is as the product descriptions says, a large bag of raw hazelnuts. I make these chocolate peanut butter treats and like to chop up hazel nuts to use for decoration and texture. I have to say, I was surprised by the shear amount of them!",positive
"Not only is the name catchy, the flavor is fabulous! It has a nice rich aroma and does not have that burnt aftertaste that many coffees take on. I have several other blends from this company, but like to use this one on my workout days as it gives me an extra kick. I see the dragon on the top of the K Cup and head into the gym in warrior mode!  :)",positive
Great for low carb cooking,positive
I just like the taste and flavor,positive
"Very good. Great flavor, no additions!",positive
"I've had my Dolce Gusto machine for 4 years. I love my Esperta machine and how it lets me make a custom brew, even with my name on it!The  coffees and chocochino (which my son really likes) are awesome. I like the caps and lattes. The foam, the layers, the taste--can't beat it. I can't find them here in the U.S. anymore, so I order online--Very Happy with the beverages and machine. I only wish they'd keep the points program-I lost a lot of points. On my way to have a delicious macchiato. Side note: I even use Nescafe instant coffee-it is delicious!",positive
Yummy. Hide these. Addicting. Got fillings?,positive
"We have used this product for 20 years.  When Phillsbury sropped making we could no longer find it in stores.  Finally another company picked up the patten.  We are so lucky to find it on Amozon.com  It is not bitter, takes little shelf space, mixes great, just not in coffee and sweet tea but virtually anything, make your own low cal salad dressings and a host of other things with it.  THANK YOU AMAZON!LD",positive
Excellent flavor. Dissolved well.,positive
"I have tried cakes with whiskey and vodka, but the rum taste is the best. The cake needed to be bigger, as it didn't last long on new years day.",positive
Came as promise really fresh would recommend buying them,positive
One of my favorite Noosa flavors. It has a nice mixture of sweetness and tart.,positive
Love it! Tastes good and easy to mix and use.,positive
I use this in place of all purpose flour for most recipes.,positive

Family favorite.  We definitely prefer the chewy in our house.,positive
I really enjoyed the heat!  Too bad they aren’t sold any more☹️,positive
Great for a snack and wonderful price.,positive

We have a Nespresso machine and finding a great decaf was not easy. That said this Decaf Espresso coffee is delicious. My wife and I really like it and cannot recommend it enough to our friends and family. Do yourself a favor and give this Decaf a try if you want a good everyday coffee for your Nespresso machine.,positive
Nice seeds.....,positive
With three small dog I keep a puppy pad in their room just in case.  Usually one of them uses the pad about once a week on average.  These Fetchers Doggie Pads work well.  They are generously sized and fit in the pee pad holder I have.  The Fetchers pads are thicker than the pads I was using previously and seem to control odor better.  They hold a good amount of urine without any leaks or run off.  These pads make clean up a breeze and control odor well.,positive
My BF loves this stuff.  It does smell like blue berry muffins baked right in your cup. I thought it would taste weird.  But I like as well,positive
"Out of all the flavors Think Thin offers, this is the best one. No artificial sweetener/flavor after taste. Each bite is enjoyable and satisfying.",positive
"I have never tried Buckwheat before and didn’t really know what to expect. I wanted to try the SIRTfood diet and buckwheat is one of the ingredients. I have to say, these are really good. I mixed it with a little bit of almond milk, some unsweetened coconut, and a little bit of honey. It was a very good and filling breakfast. I would definitely buy this again.",positive
"I've recently learned that gluten does not agree with me much so I jumped at a chance to try these crackers. They're SO. GOOD. The sea salt has a hint of garlic and rosemary which gave them a great little 'oomph' of flavor. They were delicious with hummus but just as good alone. As for the cheddar flavor...IT'S LIKE HAVING GLUTEN-FREE CHEESE-ITS.I was a bit skeptical about these cheddar ones at first but I devoured them! They're crunchy and cheesy and yummy. I didn't have to worry about not feeling great after eating a serving of these. I appreciate the simplicity of the ingredients list. The packaging is cute, too.I'm very happy with these; they are most likely going to become a staple in my pantry.Thanks to Simple Mills for letting me try these!",positive
excellant results,positive
"Just no. Chili flavored gravy,no meat. Might be ok on a hot dog or to make cheese dip.",negative
I can't always find it in the locals stores so I was delighted that I can purchase a quantity with you on line.  Ii is the best salt substitute out there.,positive
I love having the oversized teabags--use two to brew a gallon pitcher in about an hour with just hot water from the sink.  I then transfer to jugs in the refrigerator and use when needed daily.  Love the flavor and the convenience and the money it saves me from store bought diet teas.  Sweetened just enough and tea is fresh flavored and delightful!,positive
"I have purchased Green Mountain coffees many times. This Pumpkin Spice coffee I have been so disappointed in. This order I received has no taste, or smell of Pumpkin Spice. What happened. I bought the 80 cup value box to get me thru the fall. Again, very disappointed.",negative
"I wish I had read the reviews before ordering. I thought I was ordering falafel, as pictured. I didn't bother to read the description of the product, because I thought I was getting the item clearly pictured. I searched for falafel, this product came up, I added it to my cart and moved on to the next product. Like the other reviewers, though, I didn't receive falafel, I received Falafel King HUMMUS - which is a different product entirely. I thought my shopper had screwed up, but when I checked my order, I saw the problem, after the fact.  Clearly Amazon isn't getting the message to update the picture (though I also reported a problem with the description/product, so maybe someday they will actually update it). While I appreciate the convenience of delivered groceries, this is the second time I've ordered them through amazon and the second time there has been a problem. Not a good average so far.",negative
BEST BUTTERSCOTCH COOKIES EVER!!! Being emphatic j no it yelling lol. They were utterly amazing!!! I could make them myself but it was nice not having to be the cookie maker. I ordered 2 more orders. Then I’ll have to make my own. They are the best cookies I’ve had in a very loooong time!,positive
Tastes great! Good ingredients!,positive
The Peppermint flavor is as good as the other flavors.The 10 oz can can be easily shipped in gift boxes for Christmas.  The candy is individually  wrapped.The cost is reasonable for the average  consumer and their  family.,positive
Good price for the Bar,positive
Better buy more than one....Add some rotisserie chicken...and don't plan on any leftovers.,positive
"I'm usually not one to write reviews, but dang this stuff is goooood!",positive
"Excellent in my overnight oats! Yummy in oatmeal cookies too! Love this stuff! I mix it with almond milk, so yummy!",positive
I bought this product for a summer party to use to make lemon peppermint drinks.  Unforchently every single stick was broken and unusable.  This product can not be returned so unless you are going to crush them anyway DO NOT BUY.,negative
I like the strawberry extract because it is very near the taste of fresh strawberries.  I used it in strawberry cookies and the extract made the cookies even more tasty.,positive
"This tastes better than regular Pepsi with less sugar and no corn syrup, awesome!  Can't wait till it's in the stores!",positive
A little on the sticky side but very tasty.,positive
This brand is much better than others. I used to go to specialty markets in northern Arizona to find decent cactus honey powder. This brand so far beats them all both in price and taste. This product tastes so much like good honey that I am using about half the dose I used to use for my green teas. I have been buying this for quite some time and will continue to get it from here. Plus free price shipping? It's a deal!,positive
"LOVE THE TASTE,HUBBY MAD I DID'NT GET HIS FAV BUT YOU SNOOZE YOU LOSE DUDE. I WILL BE ORDERING SOME FOR HIM SOON.",positive
I love this tea! It’s refreshing and is considered safe during intermittent fasting.,positive
"These are so yummy! I add them to our healthy breakfast cereals to make them taste less bland, and they reconstitute well in oatmeal. They are also good to snack on right out of the bag.",positive
"They taste really good, like I just had fried chicken, but they are stale. Weird texture. Extremely expensive for what you get. Figured it was worth the try for curiosity.",negative
my fav green tea! it is nice and crisp. The rice flavor just adds another note of interest.,positive
Colors turned out great. There is a slight taste to the powders but it’s not that strong,positive
"It was clumpy, not creamy.",negative
I am a big coffee drinker and love a good cup of joe. On a recent trip to Canada to visit Niagra Falls there was a Tim Horton's coffee shop across the street from our hotel. We soon found out where to get our morning joe. First time trying it and it was excellent. Very tasty and not the least bit bitter like some popular coffee houses offer.I liked it so much I looked for it on Amazon and was pleasantly surprised to find it. Tasted just as good at home as it did at their retail location. I will be buying more soon. I find this particular coffee tastier than Dunkin Donuts coffee.Great pricing on amazon and with Prime shipping is a breeze.,positive
"Many people do not know much about honey except what they see in a grocery store as a thick amber colored liquid.  But I promise you that there is much more to know. What you are seeing is the crystalization of sugar coming out of the water in the honey and this is absolutely normal. ALL honey will do this!  I’ll try to explain this here and how you can easily and quickly reliquefy the sugar crystals back into the water in the honey. As you know honey is very, very sweet. It is sweeter than cane or beet sugar. That sweetness comes from an overabundance of glucose sugar molecules in the water of the honey. It is extremely concentrated sugar made that way by the bees. There is so much of an overabundance that there is an over-saturation of the water with these molecules. Honey will spontaneously on it’s own crystalize. It does this in the hive as well!  The fact is, this crystalization actually preserves the flavor and quality of the honey. I will interject here that honey is a product made by bees for THEIR survival over cold Winters… not for our survival. Remember bees get sugars in the form of nectar from the flowers that grow during Spring, Summer, and Fall, concentrate it and store it in the hive. The bees do not make their honey for mankind. In the hive the honey will be used for food to keep the bees alive. We steal part of the honey (BUT NOT ALL) for our own use but sometimes forget that it is not really being made for us humans. We are just the lucky recipients only because the beekeepers love these bees because they are so fascinating of God’s creatures. Now to change the crystals back into the water in the honey simply put the honey jar into center a saucepan. Fill the saucepan with water about half way up the uncovered glass honey jar. Do not allow any water to touch the honey! You are going to gently heat up the honey like you would heat the milk in a baby bottle. You will heat this for about 10 minutes and stir occasionally. You will note that the amber color comes back perfectly. Allow the honey to fully cool and you are done. Remember when it re-crystalizes it’s a normal thing (so don’t be surprised!)  and if you want to, you can repeat the hot water treatment again and again with no harm to the honey. Having said all this, the following is for you advanced honey students! Many people like the crystallized part of the honey because it takes much longer for it to dissolve in your mouth and allows time for the nuances of exquisite flavors to be sensed by your tongue. Something that you will not get with the liquid honey. Some advanced cooking recipes actually call for crystallized honey as an ingredient because of this. Finally, please know this. Without the bees on this earth all humans will perish. I hope that this will help someone and God Bless all including the bees!",positive
Usually buy it at store but they run out. Good value for your money,positive
"My package arrived without damage. I was going through a tiny bottle every week or so. For someone that loves this and seriously puts it on everything from jambalaya to eggs, it's a great bargain buy. I would suggest keeping a small bottle and use this to refill the smaller bottle with. I was worried that this would be a knock off, but it was the same Chipotle Tabasco, just in a large restaurant sized jug.",positive
My daughter doesn’t like the taste of it.,negative
Better than any of the grove square offerings.,positive
product is fine so far,positive
"I absolutely love belgian waffles. I always look forward to staying at hotels where they have a ""make your own waffle"" breakfast. Those waffles always seem to be the best.

Using this mix with that iron makes the best belgian waffles ever!",positive

It was hard to neatly slip the cupcakes in it that were already decorated. It would be better to decorate the cupcake after the paper was put around it they were definitely sturdy.

Best sriracha sauce ever tasted! Clean and simple flavor with perfect amount of heat. Enhances but doesn’t overpower the flavor of dishes.,positive

I have been making burritos for years. I have used many brands but this is the fist time that no matter what I did they were wet dough.  I used the microwave and I used a skillet and they remained wet and doughy.  I threw them away. but not before I ruined 10 burritos trying to use them.,negative

Very good!  Only a few drops needed to sweeten your coffee.,positive
This is my favorite Bai flavor.  Had to start ordering from Amazon because my grocery store stopped stocking it.,positive

Pricy but yummy,positive
Very tasty.  I add it to instant miso soup.,positive
These chocolates are wonderful but somehow they melted between packaging and getting inside my house. I finished them off but they were no where near what they would have been.,negative
Does not taste like honey. Too waxy and nasty after taste. Taste very synthetic.,negative
Really good coffee. Shipping was a problem. The coffee was stuffed into a manila envelope that was too small. Coffee pods broke apart. I can fix the kcups but they need to package it better. I will still order more in the future because they taste great.,positive

The package came in this condition. I would like the Item replaced.,negative
I have saved a small bottle of the Runamok Maple Jasmine Flavored Maple Syrup since Christmas. It is so good I could drink it. It is sweet but refreshing at the same time.

"I've been trying to drink more tea in an effort to curb my 4-5 cup daily coffee habit. I tried the peach apricot green tea by this brand and really liked it, but while it helped me cut down a bit on the coffee, I just wanted something a little stronger to better satisfy my coffee cravings. I'd seen this tea available before, but while I love fresh raspberries, I absolutely hate artificial raspberry flavor. As this was a black tea and likely stronger than the green, I decided I'd go ahead and give it a try and give it to my daughter for colds and such.I feel like a fool for waiting so long...it's delicious! Like the green tea, this tastes like fresh fruit, and not flavoring. It also has more of a caffeine kick, and I noticed that yesterday, I only had two cups of coffee. I had a cup in the morning and one in the afternoon. When the craving hit me early evening, I infused a cup of this tea, and steeped it longer, so it was extra strong. For a late night cup, I used the same leaves and made it a little weaker, since it was so late. It satisfied my urge to drink more coffee, and I was able to sleep unlike with drinking coffee late, which can sometimes make me jittery.I'm happy to have tried this tea and am impressed by the flavor. I don't know how this brand manages to make their teas taste so good and fruity, but they've nailed it. I have a feeling it will be delicious mixed with fresh squeezed lemonade, too, and will be trying it.I received a discount on this tea in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review. Any opinion I've expressed is purely mine and based on my own personal experience drinking this tea.",positive
"Organic Pineapple Powder, 8 Ounce, Freeze Dried surprised me! I bought this product because the canned version of pineapple juice was sold out. So, this powdered version fulfilled my craving. Firstly, you can fulfill any objections of the recommended spoonful of powder as being: 1) too thin, 2) Not much flavor and 3) lack of body by simply, increasing the amount of powder. Secondly, let the powder sit and dissolve throughly in the refrigerator (make it cold). It works from here!",positive
"This movie could have been very good, but comes up way short. Cheesy special effects and so-so acting. I could have looked past that if the story wasn't so lousy. If there was more of a background story, it would have been better. The plot centers around an evil Druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. The movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps plodding on. Christopher Walken has a part, but it is completely senseless, as is most of the movie. This movie had potential, but it looks like some really bad made for TV movie. I would avoid this movie.",negative
"All 10 stalks arrived green and healthy. Packaging was great. Roots were coated in that gel-like substance for retaining water and the whole product was wrapped in brown paper, and cushioned in packing peanuts. It seemed they’ve just developed their roots as they’re very short. Leaves are quite small but very green. They’re all lovely. I’m very happy with my purchase and will definitely buy again.",positive
"These The Humble Seed Grain Free Crackers are crunchy, super tasty, and full of ingredients that are good for you with none of the bad.The package comes with three individual boxes of crackers, each enclosed in a foil/mylar bag.  They are the perfect size for dipping or snacking.  (I ate the whole box in one sitting!)  You can see the goodness of the six seeds in each and every cracker.If you are looking for something that is exceptionally tasty and good for many diets, then get these great crackers today! :)",positive
"I bought two boxes of these. They’re so good. However, I notice on one of the boxes, the corner is damaged and the packaging is torn. I thought, no big deal, the bars are individually wrapped. I was wrong. I’ve eaten two bars and they taste stale.",positive
This is the second box I have ordered that was sour.  Had to dump both boxes.  Probably stored incorrectly at the storage facility.,negative
these are wonderful without seeds...fabulous when using a lot of lemons in your dishes or putting lemons in drinking water,positive
"Needed a large quantity for separating into individual bags, but couldn't afford to spend the money on Jelly Belly Peach Jelly Beans. I have to say, the Peach Flavor of this brand is excellent, as is the price, and everyone thought they were delicious!!!",positive
"I had this tea, or one similar, at a local Himalayan restaurant. Deliciously light and with a small bit of honey to sweeten it up its a great afternoon tea.",positive
Beware. The bottle cap was damaged and the honey leaked out. There is NO way to return or get a refund on this product. VERY disappointed.,negative
"Dried out, unetable!!!!",negative
I used to eat these cookies when I was a child. You do not see them too often in the supermarket anymore; they taste just as good as they used to be.,positive
"I pour a handful in a bowl, run hot water on them and let them sit for 3–5 minutes, rinse them off and eat them as is. A little too easy.Delivered frozen solid from across the USA, fresh flavor and smell, great texture, tails pop right off, - no hassle.",positive
"I was surprised how good these tasted.  I don't generally like the Lipton Brisk ice-tea so I wasn't sure how this would be, and I can say that these were great!  I had been buying another brand of cold brew tea but they stopped making it, so I was pleased to see Lipton carrying it.",positive
"These are delicious, not salty, crunchy, and perfectly balanced with a touch of sweetness. These are definitely the best seaweed snacks I have found thus far (and I've been testing quite a few). I highly recommend them. You can keep munching or stop, well sated.",positive
GREAT STUFF --------  Would not eat fried catfish without it.,positive
This is absolutely the best teriyaki beef jerky I have ever eaten,positive
I love this stuff for an early morning or late night snack... I know i'm weird but it tastes good and is not overly salty.,positive
"Love this seasoning! It's a great way to limit your sodium intake, and is great on anything from pasta, to salads, or meats...basically anything",positive
"I liked the product a lot and the taste. Goes great in my yogurt. Sadly my sensitive stomach can’t deal with the roughness of the grain.  So if you have a sensitive stomach I suggest you pass, otherwise great product and flavor. I wish I could enjoy it.",positive
"These are really good, but the price is a bit steep. They were delivered quickly and I’d buy them again.",positive
The bacon arrived after the “use by” date.It was a gift. Sad.Nueske chose not to send another pack.,negative
Gives any beef dog a taste of ny,positive
"My favorite candy is Brach’s butterscotch. No other butterscotch has the rich, buttery flavor of Brach’s. These taste nothing like the original. Totally disappointing!!",negative
amazing results every time you use this salts,positive
People at work love them. I could not find them at a local store so I ordered them here on Amazon. Yummy strawberry hard candy.,positive
Tastes amazing and isHealthy!!,positive
"Very delicious tortillas!!! Ideal for wraps, tacos and quesadillas! Ever since being on a low-carb diet I have been missing a good quesadilla and finally found the perfect wrap to make a keto version! These tortillas are very tasty and you would NEVER know they are low-carb, they taste like the real deal! I'll be trying the entire keto assortment! Paired it here with some smoked salmon and avocado; match made in heaven :)",positive
"Generally, for hot drinks you have: coffee, tea, chocolate, or chai. For people like me who aren't addicted to coffee, and who find tea boooooorrrrring, there are only two choices left: heavy-flavored chocolate (that gets old fast … even for a chocoholic like me) or lighter, chai tea. I like the Spiced Chai Latte but there are several different types to add a little HOT variety to your life.",positive
Very tasty sausage and fresh.,positive
This is so good. SO GOOD! But the calories... whew... Far too much,positive
"Great coffee and great service, couldn't resist the chance to try at such a wonderful introduction but will buy again",positive
These are super fresh because the smell is AMAZING!!!  The pods themselves beautiful.,positive
Loved the taste. I add some coconut milk and coconut sugar to make it a latte.,positive
Best cookies. Daughter is gf and dairy free. I love these too.,positive
"Well, I gotta say: kudos and mad vegetable props!! lol ...to Libby's (and Amazon) for these peas. 😄Ingredients: just peas and water - check.Low sodium: 15 mg per serving - check.NO DENTED CANS!!!!!! Not a single one! Check.Look: I'm vegan, and single. I don't make fancy meals; I like things cheap and easy.(hopefully not self-referential, there) I love peas. These are excellent peas; they'relow in sodium, and they were $3.00 cheaper when I bought them, but ... oh well.No dented cans! A first, in my experience. A great big THANK YOU to LIbby's for notsending us your 'rejects', and to Amazon if they had any influence as far as that goes. 😊EDIT: Just wanted to add that when I bought these on July 28, 2016, the price was $11.78for 12 cans. Now it's up to $14.47. Sure, it's less than $3.00 more, but I can get the storebrand no-salt peas for the same price or less, when they go on sale. As someone on alimited budget, I have to save on costs wherever I can. I *was* going to order two more casesof these today, but when I saw the price hike, I decided NOT to. So Libby's, you gained a fan -but you lost a customer when you jacked up the price. Too bad!  😩UPDATE: Well, on Aug. 11, the price was down to $12.94, so I bought three more cases.  😊",positive
"Got this pack on sale for less than $20. Usual great Gatorade, great price and free shipping.",positive
"These are hard, and taste too sweet.",negative
The flavor is so light that it doesn't effect the taste of whatever I'm frying. I use it only for frying. I use olive oil for salads.,positive

"Received: August 2021Best By: September 2022This Protein Brothers Biltong Beef Jerky was a major hit with the family. We love biltong, have even made our own, and found this biltong by Protein Brothers was very well-made and seasoned. All in all, just about the perfect biltong that the family devoured.

"11/23/22 Still doing great, see how big it's gotten!  I'm need to prune it and put in a bigger pot next spring!So far its been doing very well!  It was in the white pot pictured next to the pot its in now.  It's transitioning to this bigger pot(smaller one inside it) because I'd like to grow it bigger fir my living room.I'm considering getting another one to keep small and maybe one more to keep at the office.  I keep it in the bathroom in indirect bright light and water about once a week, after its dry.  I don't move it much; read they don't like to be moved.If I order another, my only critique would be that it comes in a pot with drainage holes...this one did not.  However the way they had the rocks on the top did conceal that it was still in a growers pot, inside the white pot....so some drainage was happening,  just not visible to me.",positive
I’ve taken AMU nutrition programm so my consultent gave me an advice to use this job’s tears. I have eaten it first time ever.  I exchanged the white rice with it.,positive
Like all aspects and health benefits of walnuts.,positive
I love the packaging of the tea product and the variety of tea flavors! I would definitely buy it again! Also try two different tea bags together to infuse your own unique blend of fruity flavor tea!,positive
Tastes fantastic and takes less than white sugar to sweeten things.,positive
I've never cooked with Couscous before so I'm not able to know yet how versatile it is . I must say that what I did use it for made my soup very delicious. I like the way it's package .  I usually cook for myself alone so this supply should last me for awhile . I will gladly buy from you again in the future .,positive
It tasted just like salt,positive
"Have used these mints for years and have never been disappointed. However, I am unhappy with the significant price increase.",positive
I kept these but every one of them is smashed when you unwrap them. Would not order from them again.,negative
"I cannot believe how wonderful this is, but it is almost better than the sugared brand.  Hell, it is better!",positive
great product. fresh,positive
"This is a fun mix of candy that I think kids especially would love. There is a huge variety of different candies in many flavors and types. This would be great for kids' parties, Halloween, candy dishes, etc. I didn't sample everything but what I've tasted has all been good, everything seems very fresh (the taffy is soft which is always a good sign). The expiration date is almost 2 years from the date I received it. It seems pretty pricey for 3 pounds of fairly ordinary candy but I think you're paying for the fact that you're getting a lot of variety in a single bag.",positive
Tasty and a good caffeine drink for a pick me up during a work day!,positive
"Canadian husband introduced me to these and they're delicious - easily the best flavor of the soda bottle candies, although not actually tasting of bubblegum. The only soda bottle gummies I can find here are the Haribo Cola ones. Purchased these to fill the craving. Pricey, but would buy again.",positive
"I first purchased these as a trial from a health food store, as they advertised and their photos showed a nice, coffee-like beverage. I was pleasantly surprised and have been a huge fan ever since. Add a half teaspoon of virgin coconut oil to this while hot water is poured over, and let it steep for 4-minutes. It actually has a hint of coffee, without the caffeine or gluten. There are several flavors and you'll love them!Cheers!",positive
These are the best pretzels that I've ever had and I've tried quite a few. They also only have about 5 ingredients that are all natural. No chemicals in these and they somehow get them to taste the best.,positive
"I like this product but I do use a bit less then the 3/4 cup called for in my waffle maker  I also let it cook another minute past when the bell goes off.  It crisps it up which makes it hold up better to a fruit compote topping that I make.  A dollop of home made whip cream, and voila, a lovely breakfast treat.  I've tried others and all I can describe is a way too doughy textures.",positive
We have been using this coffee flavor and brand for some time and love it.,positive
"Cannot eat, wasted money",negative
Lot of green tea for a good price. Tastes good and is about as good as genuine Chinatown green tea I’ve purchased in New York Chinatown from a friend who is Chinese who knows what is the best green team to get.,positive
These are great and low in sodium unlike so much other jerkey,positive
"This product deserves zero stars. I regret that I purchased four boxes, lured in by reviews that are truly inexplicable. I have tried three of the four boxes, and each one tastes quite watery. In addition, several pods ended up in the trash because my Keurig would not process them. (I get a message saying something about contents being under pressure.) Because the pod is punctured, it's useless and in the trash it goes. I tried making cups with just 6 ounces and it still tastes like mostly water. And I don't like strong coffee--yet even to me, there is no flavor. It's infuriating. I'll be contesting the purchase with my credit card company.",negative
"I received this product on time and in great shape.  The tea tastes great and the expiration date is way in the future.  So, no problems, just great tasting tea!",positive
They don't even taste like brownies. They honestly taste like chocolate bars or something. Smh,negative
Reminds me of childhood ❤,positive
"Reminded me of home sweet home. I’ve tried it all, but South African biscuits are the best",positive
"I have been buying pacific chai for yearsThen all of a sudden with my last two orders the color of the chai changed and along with it, the flavor changed as well. Heartbroken.",negative

Huge bag of great tasting coffee!,positive
good service and quality,positive
"2 of the 6 bottles were broken on the first shipment. I was sent replacements without asking which was nice. The second shipment had 3 out of 6 bottles broken, no replacement sent. I canceled all reordering",negative
Great herb blend and taste.,positive
"After seeing this pasta mentioned by a favourite cook (Barefoot Contessa) I was very curious to try it. And am I glad I did! It is truly the best dried pasta I've ever eaten, and my husband and I then stocked up on boxes of the stuff when we visited the USA recently, to bring back to Dubai. Wish it was a bit cheaper on Amazon though!",positive
"Liked the taste but not the harm it does for the gut, pancreas and health in general.",negative
Product arrived broken. Still tried to attempt to make this.......it then fell apart....,negative
"If you like chocolate you will love this. I decided to stop drinking coffee due to how caffeine was effecting me. This definitely does the trick, it gives you a boost of energy that last through out the day without the crash you get from coffee. The only downfall is you don't get the lovely smell like you do with coffee.",positive
Can’t live without this delicious and soothing tea.,positive
"A good item to keep around.  Couldn't find it in the markets anymore, so Amazon is a great way to restock my pantry.",positive
"This makes the best hot chocolate!  Warm some milk, stir in this magic & enjoy!",positive
Daughter and roomies loved this!,positive
Very disappointing. All these flavors have a bad aftertaste. The worst flavor is pineapple.,negative
"The product was outdated, expired, dried out.  The cost was too much for what was received. Had to throw into garbage not edible.",negative
"good tasting coffee, all the flavors and roasts including the variety pack are real good",positive
"All a bit confusing. The ordering tab says the quantity is 12 boxes, the item description states 6 boxes, but after ordering I received a single box! Amazon were quick to issue a refund.",negative
SO DELICIOUS..,positive
I was so surprise upon the arrival of these sunflowers in my whole foods order. They came perfectly bundled and last like 2 weeks!,positive
Mild good flavor.,positive
love this gum. great flavor & long lasting. will buy again,positive
"Love this product!  The ""Bob's RED MILL Gluten Free, all purpose"" flour was getting to cost too much, so I tried this one, and found it great.  No need to add xanthan gum to my baked goods any more.  And baked goods were impossible to tell I had used gluten free.  Great taste!",positive
Terrible product. It is not granulated like trulemon. It is a powder like talc and forms a glob with fluid. Might be ok in a blended drink but not in a Bloody Mary.,negative
"The chestnut tastes great, either eat as a snack or add to my dishes.",positive
"This is a decent cup of Earl Grey Tea.  Obviously not for the purist, more about getting a quick cuppa before you head out to work.  Like most kcup products you can do better if you have a traditional tea service but for what it is supposed to be quick, convenient, good, it does it's job in an exemplary fashion.",positive
Tasty Tacos! Midwest’s favorite taco place. I was so excited to see that I could get this seasoning from Amazon. Now I can get the Tasty Taco experience in the South. If I could only get their famous taco shells.,positive
"This is a rich tasting plant based milk that really helps me not miss whole milk! Love it!Use it in my back tea, coffee and it is so good in smoothies:)",positive
I like the product just wish it was more affordable and in more stores.,positive
I love these cakes. Thought they were delicious.  Hope they continue to keep them in stock.,positive
"Not sure it should be legal. We put this --and a few other spices I won't share here--on some lamb chops and just fried them. They were AMAZING. This spice tastes pretty hot by itself, which makes it a bit hard to figure out how a blend with it and other spices is going to turn out. The end result, strangely, was not hot at all. Since I like spicy, I would usually have been disappointed, but this was so good, I did not even CARE. Seriously--you have to try this. I ordered two other spices at the same time, neither of which will be getting a GOOD review.",positive
"Flavor is awesome. I was nervous. The pulp is like grapes without skin. I wish it didn't cost so much, and is less expensive than other suppliers.",positive
We used this for years back in the eighties and everyone loved it.  A grandson texted me the other day and wanted to know if I still used it.  He always put it on his mac and cheese.  So of course I looked it up on Amazon and ordered it.  We love it!,positive
"It works. The pics after2 days. I still got bit, it takes time to catch them, any other units work the same way.  I like the smallness, u can plug in anywhere 😊👍 bedroom and bathroom  We-Wife and I sometimes leave the bedroom door to patio slide door open when we are using the patio late afternoon that's why the mosquitoes are in the house. The mosquitoes are bad this year.  Anyway- excellent units for the buck. 👍",positive
Love these. Just sweet enough but not overly so.,positive
I needed to write about this key lime pie. I love key lime pie and this was amazing. Let me tell you that my husband brought me a piece from key west and it was not even as good as this one. The funny part this one comes from key west too but the taste is phenomenal so yes if you are a key lime pie lover buy it and enjoy every piece,positive
Aaammmaaazing!  So good you can’t stop eating them!,positive
It came all broke. Trying to return it.,negative
Great replacement for sugar,positive
Beautiful vibrant colors. Doesn't take much.,positive
"Flavor lasts for about one minute! But, I think most gum balls are the same.",positive
I haven’t purchased the new ones but I had a box of the old ones awhile back I have no idea what they were thinking when the put these on the market. I don’t know I may try the new ones to see if indeed they have been improved 🤔,negative
These bees are the cutest ever. I dont even want to eat them.,positive
I had tried this brand of coffee before and I love it.  Making the purchase through Amazon was a lot cheaper than buying it through one of the wholesale warehouses.,positive
We drink a lot of tea in my house and this box is perfect for us. Everyone can find a tea they like with this. I've already ordered 3 boxes.,positive
The box was too heavy for the senior citizen to pick up. Many of the items spoiled unfortunately. Doesn’t seem right,negative
Good as eggroll dip.,positive

We are avid believes in the benefits of aloe especially for relief of joint pain.  How it is processed can determine how helpful it can be.  Cold processing is best from what I have learned.  My husband and I feel better when we take it a few times a day in pomegranate juice.,positive

"I have used apple cider vinegar daily for quite some time, but have never liked the taste.  The Twisted Shot has done the seemingly impossible, makes apple cider vinegar taste great, and also includes a dose of several other superfoods.This product allows you to get turmeric, ginger, cinnamon and cayenne all in a single dose (it seems like everyday they find a new benefit from theses ingredients, especially turmeric).This product is a great addition to my daily routine!",positive
"Mixed with greek yogurt for a chicken marinade....and wow, flavor was amazing!",positive
"Use it all the time.  Don't live near Costco, so this is a good value",positive
"Nothing was cracked or melted. Everything was years away from expiring. There was an even mix of all types of dagashi, not too much sweet and not too much salty. This is the dream dagashi pack! I’ll be buying this again. One thing I would love is more pickled plum dagashi.",positive
"Let me 1st start by saying if you don't like heat and Cajun spices, keep scrolling. But if you like heat and flavor, Get This In Your Pot!!! Good stuff!!!",positive
The variety of the sweet and salty were the perfect mix. I will definitely recommend it as a great appreciation gift during season. I loved the Japanese peanuts and the “elote” and “mango” shaped lollipops.,positive
"These are delicious! I highly recommend them! They are low calorie, don’t have all the additives, and great to have with you just in case you need a snack now! Buy them you won’t be disappointed!",positive
These are so freaking good! I buy them for the office and at home! I’m not big into hot stuff but the flamin hot peanuts are so good I just power through the spice. All three are great!,positive
more water than tuna,negative
It’s what I expected. Not sure what to say here...?,positive
Expired by over a year when received.,positive
It is smokey/heavily roasted in flavor and a bit sour.I should have just made my own cold brew but I thought buying this would be better in quality.It does taste like I just took folgers brewed coffee and added ice.Just go and soak your ground coffee in water over night. that will likely taste better,negative
The teabags are so much better than the kcups.,positive
"Apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called ""movie."" They described ""blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence."" I saw no ""intrigue."" I instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. I saw no ""violence."" At least, I saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with ""impervious"" skin--but here I am perhaps revealing too much of the ""plot."" Furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable. Whatever you may choose to do, I will always remain Correct, Jonathan Tanner  P.S. I was not blinded by the choreography.",negative
"Perfect, yummy mix, not too spicy by or salty for little ones or light-weights 😋. I multi-purpose the heck out of this, it is great for chili, but also grilled chicken tacos or shredded chicky nachos, works with pork for burritos with green chili added.",positive
It tastes great and I enjoy every one I have after my workout.,positive
"super hot, only a few drops needed",positive
Best sugar substitute I have ever tasted.,positive
Love them! The only brand I buy now.,positive
No fluff it’s more like batter,negative
"As Southerners of LA background, my husband and I prefer this for our morning coffee.  The price is great as a 13.5oz package sells for $5.50 in most grocers, Walmart, WinnDixie and Publix.",positive
did not like the flavor or the texture of these. next time will need to order just one pack of 6 instead of 3. just thought i was getting a good deal.,negative
"Excellent. Broil with lemon, salt & pepper for best results.",positive
These are my downfall...why do they come in 5# bags...lol Even so they dont last long around our house. Great tasting! Unfortunately I will be ordering these again.,positive

This is false advertising! Candy is maybe 3” not 10” as advertised.. can not refund! Very disappointed. DO NOT BUY!,negative
"Cookies are fabulous and deserve 5 stars. However, the price of over 15$ for ONE package of cookies was way out of range. You can buy them at the store for less than 3$ for the package. This item was misleading in the description containing the words ""7 packs"".",negative
First time ordering this extract and will definitely not be the last.  The flavor is stronger than any that we have previously tried and will be perfect for the baking we are doing.,positive
"Got this through the Vine program, 48 packets of loose tea.  It only takes a few minute to steep, and what a wonderful flavor, smooth and delicate flavors, a really treat.",positive
"I did not know what to expect from these bars. My family eats a lot of protein bars, but I only eat them occasionally. I wanted to give these a try. The packaging was nice and simple, and the explanation card inside made perfect sense. When I first unwrapped the bar, I thought it was a bit hard, but it broke and chewed easily. The aroma was of coffee/chocolate and dates. This bar is very dense. Biting into it, though, is fine. I thought I would only eat half the bar, but I ate it all. That explains the rating.",positive
"Great product. Many uses, phenomenal results.",positive
Awesome cocoa powder.  Very comforting knowing it’s organic.,positive
My kids begged me for this assortment of Japanese snacks. And we had a lot of fun as a family sitting around the table trying them all out.,positive
"My son usually purchases his seeds at a local convenience store.  Lately, they have been out of ranch and BBQ.  It never occurred to me to check Amazon.com for my son's favorite sunflower seeds.  On a whim, I decided to do a search.  Low and behold, Amazon had his seeds, and at a better price!  It's great to order by the case and have them delivered directly to our front door.  Thank you Amazon.",positive
"As always, Epic Bar has a great flavor - just enough kick to it, but not so much it burns your mouth. Perfect for after workouts and for anyone on Whole30 because it's sugar free.",positive
Thus custard us light & creamy - add mixed berries or fresh peaches for terrific summer desseet!,positive
I always love the holiday blend because I like the subtle spice that it contains.,positive
"What did I not like? Mostly, I did not like finding dozens of live, wriggling, tiny white worm-like bugs in my coffee grinds. Call me particular, but my other beans don't try to crawl away from me when I empty my grounds bin. Disgusting. Dumped everything out, refilled with Lavaza, and brewed 5 times to clear any remaining beans or bugs out of my machine. This is gross!!!!!",negative
"This soup is one of the best soups I've ever had. It's smooth, creamy and the tomato doesn't bother my stomach. I LOVE this soup!",positive
Good yeast that works as described. I use it to make apple wine from store bought apple cider.,positive

Loved it in Germany and now we can love it in Texas.,positive
Really wanted to like it. Tastes bitter,negative
As expected would order again,positive
"These are sinfully awesome and although they are a bit pricey; they are worth every taste. I had these years ago at a resort and never could find them. So when I saw, I indulged & bought it.  It’s not everyday that you get to taste this level of buttery smooth chocolates. I will have to exercise a bit more for these occasional treats.",positive
"For those of you asking about the taste, well- taste is very subjective, but I can tell you this is NOT the sweet and salty taste you get from drinking the liquid at the bottom of a jar of sauerkraut. It is far stronger, like what you get from fermented foods. It’s not quite as strong as kimchee, though. I would not say I enjoy the taste, but because I enjoy strong foods such as mackerel, I could easily tolerate this.  It also appears to be of high quality.More importantly, I bought this because my stomach and esophagus felt so weird that I went to the doctor for a CATSCAN. While I am not a doctor, and this review does not constitute medical advice of any kind, yadda yadda yadda, I feel like drinking this stuff in the morning and at night made me feel better within two weeks.A note on the packaging: it’s not always easy to tear these pouches open and get the liquid into a glass without spilling it. If you’re like me, you might want to tear the pouch over a wide and shallow bowl. That way you don’t miss any of the juice. This stuff is precious, but not exactly cheap. Then, lift the bowl with both ands and drink this cabbage “elixir.” Enjoy.",positive

"""I am thoroughly impressed with the Lavazza Super Crema Whole Bean Coffee Blend! The medium espresso roast is perfect for my taste, providing a rich and bold flavor with a smooth finish. The beans are of high quality and have a beautiful aroma that fills my kitchen every time I brew a cup. I also appreciate that it is a blend of both Arabica and Robusta beans which adds to the complexity of the flavors. I have tried many different types of coffee, but this one is by far my favorite. It is perfect for my morning cup of Joe or as an after dinner treat. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is a coffee lover!""",positive
Absolutely love these perfect little treat without the guilt,positive
I don’t think these are even Dubble Bubble…. The shells are falling off the gum balls and they are EXTREMELY stale and hard. Super disappointed. I want my money back!,negative
What the hell is this? It ain't a Suzy Q. It deserves no stars. This is a dry tastless knock off. Please bring back the original. So disappointed,negative
Great-as described! A+,positive
The leaves are too small to use with a tea strainer. This should only be brewed in a tea pot,negative
This stuff is amazing on salmon! And on chicken on the BBQ.,positive
My kids liked them so that's at all that matters lol,positive
"This mix tastes like the real thing. No weird gritty taste that gluten free items tend to have. No weird baking results. You can substitute this for any dish that uses regular Bisquick. My non-gluten free family actually prefers it to regular Bisquick, because it makes much more fluffy pancakes and waffles.",positive
Perfect size for the cupcakes!!,positive
Tasty and decently nutritious.,positive
The castle were stale. You can smell them when you opened up the package.,negative
Delicious chocolates!!,positive
"We are really enjoying this lovely, rich cacao powder, So far we've used it for smoothies and no bake energy bites. The flavor is great and I love that my kids think they are getting a treat because of the chocolate flavor, but I'm feeding them something healthy at the same time. I would definitely order again, especially because it's organic, too.",positive
"Yum, now I have a whole case of shelf stable coconut creamy milk. I use it in my coffee, soups and other dishes it is great.",positive
"Several positives:-Best price for larger 8 oz size with built-in grinder.-Grinder can be unscrewed from bottle, and is an excellent grinder.-Salt quality is fantastic.",positive
Only what you need CACAO PASTE that’s it. Is really good for baking. Buy it!!! Good price comparing to the others 😊,positive
The is a real winner. Very tasty & quite healthy,positive
"Per my mother, “Honest to goodness they taste homemade.”",positive
Worked well for my recipe!,positive
Absolutely delicious I love these pancakes they're my favorite brand of low carb pancakes,positive
Use this on mornings One hour before I plan to play tennis.  Gives me that extra boost.  I’m small so only need half of the drink at a time.,positive
If you know green curry you will know this product is terrible. To get any flavor from this you have to use too much. By that time the scoville heat is melting your skin off of your skull. Buy a different product or make your own. It's very easy.,negative
These are delicious and easy to make! I highly recommend them but be warned that you may eat the whole batch.,positive
My cans were all over the box. I’m sure they are all flat tasting !!! To expensive to be shipped like this,negative
The flavor was exactly as I remember from my childhood. It was such a great experience.,positive
"I often ask my supermarket cheese counter if they have any Scottish cheese, and the answer has always been no, despite them having English, Irish and sometimes even Welsh cheese. But thanks to Amazon I got some Isle of Mull cheddar in tip top condition having been carefully packed in ice. I had already purchased some Walkers oatcakes so it was just heavenly to have a couple with a thick slice of this gorgeous cheddar. For only $8 - next time I'll buy two or three.",positive
"The bag that came was totally blown open at the bottom of the bag in the box with my other items, what a mess! It looked like a million little rabbit turds",negative
I was hoping this would be a stronger coffee but was kind of disappointed it wasn’t too strong.,negative
"This tea has been my little mommy treat. It arrived swiftly, and has been a delicious little break i take twice a day. I feel like it helps my whole constitution.",positive
I always liked Hershey's Chocolate with almonds.,positive
"I bought these for myself to have after long runs, but my 12 years old stepdaughter loves them and eats them all!  So we keep buying her more!",positive
The size is not 1 ounce like it states in the description the size is 1 dram. I received a different product than in the picture. I could have gotten two bottles for the same price elsewhere.,negative
Spicy but not too spicy. Really good flavor.,positive
"ok, i have to turn off all of my twitter device updates until i get a new battery. phone goes from fully charged to dead in about 5 hours",neutral
"This almond butter was very thick, but after sitting for a moment it becomes more malleable. This is because the thicker almond goes right to the bottom, some may prefer to mix it for a thicker butter. However not doing so results in a pourable almond butter which makes it much easier to spread than if it were thick. This almond butter gives you options in terms of consistency which makes for a convenient product. Glad I bought, will likely buy again in the future and would recommend.",positive
"I heard about this coffee late.  It is a Special Edition flavor of Green Mountain, that only comes out in the spring till it's gone.  I think it would have been even better with a more bold say medimum roast versus the light roast they use.If you like coconut it adds an unusual and different taste to coffee.  I would never have thought of coconut as a flavor for coffee but it is actually very good.",positive
He's not a coffee drinker but this enables him to enjoy something warm to drink with the rest of us.  Have reordered numerous times.,positive
Bought these for a party. Used with one of Stacy's dips.,positive
Large sticks my recipe called for eight only use half that and worked perfect,positive

"Best thai soup I’ve ever had. Have tried em all. Wiped out surrounding stores and need to but a case I guess. If you don’t like it, you don’t like thai food so stick with your comfort zone.",positive
"Fresh, taste fantastic!",positive
Great tasting coffee with a mild medium roast.,positive
Great packaging and quality!,positive
"Tastes great, works well and I feel good knowing it's organic. Amazon's pricing on Simply Organic is ""simply amazing"" at often half off the prices in my local stores. Will continue to purchase!",positive
"This was a treat! It brought me back to Nepal, sitting on a mountain eating my breakfast in the cool morning air with my steaming cup of hot milk (masala) tea. I get to enjoy that now every day I make this tea. Thank you!!!",positive
"This pasta has the most wonderful, rich flavor.and the texture is superb.",positive
This yeast expires in March!  I can't possibly use all of this by that time.  Ripoff.,negative
"Although I am careful not to set me ""flavor expectations"" too high for decafs, this was a real disappointment.  If the manufacturer test brewed this coffee, I am sure they would NOT find the brewed result extra bold at all. It comes out more like hot water with a LITTLE coffee flavor.",negative
Not at all what it lappears in picture,negative
OHHHMMMMAAAGGGGGAAHHH this chocolate is so good. I got the hazelnut chocolate and cannot believe one bark piece is 11 grams of carbs. I eat the whole piece and I’m so happy.,positive
"Small, firm & delicious!!  Love the fact that they keep their firmess vs getting too soft like some others.  Cooked for close to 20 mins on low in water (but could use broth too) and added fresh kale for the last 3 minutes of cooking to wilt.  Strained after and added toppings of homemade dill/yogurt tzatziki, avocado & Siete hot sauce.  SO GOOD :-)",positive
Disappointing. Packaging was unpleasant and each rollup looked like and tasted aged and gross.,negative
"The logs that were ordered already have the dowels in them.So I did order more, the more the merrier!!  Love them.",positive
Gran sabor y buen precio.,positive
"i don't like them at all!! my daughter doesn't either! so, i took them to work to give away, and no one there will eat them either!",negative
Smooth not grainy. Well balance mix of spices.,positive
I use only King Arthur flour,positive
These bars were a one time purchase based on a recommendation for protein intake.  We rather enjoy the honey nut granola bars by the same vendor.,positive
The gummies were stale!! The delivery was late and to find ou that the gummies were stale was horrible. My son was looking forward to eating the gummies was extremely disappointed.,negative
Horrible all my slim Jim’s were rotten all expired Nov 2017.,negative
I love the Smokey nutty flavor.,positive
"We love hot salsa!  While this is not that hot, it is really good which we like.  Would love a hotter one but that is really hard to get from store bought.",positive
"This is the best curry powder I have ever tried.Good balance of spices and slight heat.Cheap price,cool logo on package too.  A must try.",positive
"I am on a plant based diet which means  no dairy. I craved for mac and cheese etc. Then I  ran across this Daiya non dairy cheese product on Amazon and I must say I am very happy with it.  I've order 3 more boxes and have had Nachos with the Zesty cheese pack and of course mac and  cheese,  yum. I'm very happy with this product .",positive
I use it for its health benefits. It is a bit bitter so I add half a teaspoon of honey.,positive
"Since Senseo pods are impossible to find, I thought I would give these a try.  Using one pod was like drinking hot water with a coffe colored tint.  Using two pods was marginally  better, but still did not yield a fuller flavor/robust cup of coffee.  I cannot recommend unless you like watery weak coffee.",negative
Good flavor without lots of calories,positive
Fits great on my shelve,positive
I have 2 1/2 for a dessert treat some nights which is only 70 calories and quite satisfying!,positive
"this is not the same peanut butter...contains sooo much oil and takes 20 minutes to stir each time you use it...Probably 30% palm oil in here, just so you know what you're buying. Jif and skippy are much better than this brand now.",negative
The roses were already starting to brown and die when they arrived.....would definitely avoid them in future flower orders,negative
"Arrived in beautiful condition, with excellent instructions",positive
Great flavor.  Exactly what I was hoping for,positive
"I am making my own mustards, have no other seeds to compare this purchase with, but I am satisfied so far.",positive
"Good color, not sure if I had a bad package but two of the colors were clumpy aND wouldn't mix.  The green and yellow.  Couldn't use those colors.  Otherwise I would have written a great review.",negative
sabor delicioso precio algo alto si los volvería comorwr,positive
Well not by again. Is not a good product. I’ve eaten orange slice candy from different vendors and this is the worst I’ve ever had. Save your money.,negative
"My favorite popcorn to use, nice and small kernels",positive
Fast shipping. The tea is deliciously fresh . Aromatic and rich.Seller cares about the tea growers and wants to raise social consciousness. Will definitely recommend and purchase again,positive
What a waste.  My tap water tastes much better.  One sip all it took and I am throwing all in the trash.  Don't buy this!,negative
"With this and the Flavacol, I will never buy microwave popcorn again. And you don't need a popper, works great in a skillet on the stove.",positive
They’re an old favorite that I’ve lived for years.,positive
Fresher than some of the over the counter product. Will continue to purchase.,positive
"Box was warped which isnt their fault but it just tasted like sour soy sauce mushy noodles. Never again. Sriracha and rice vinegar didnt help, the sourness permeated.",negative
"This coffee will punch you in the mouth as soon as you taste it.  There is no way this won't wake you up before you finish half of our first cup.  I use this in my drip coffee maker, in my espresso machine, and in my espresso press.  I would not recommend drinking this as a shot of espresso, but I use the espresso pump to make 4 oz, then mix in sweetened condensed milk and pour over ice for the best iced coffee ever.  Yes I know it is a version of Vietnamese coffee, but this version is better than any I've gotten on Buford Highway",positive
Quality coconut water product.,positive
"My mom loves this stuff.  Who am I kidding, so do i.  It's not always or even often available at the store, so I was happy to find it here.",positive
"I want to give this product a rave review. The flour is everything I want in a bread flour. I use it in combination with strong white flour  to make sourdough loaves. I also very much support the craft community which markets this flour. These are really good people! I did want to make mention, however, that, like some others who opened the box to find flour all over the place, I was unhappy to find the plastic bag inside an otherwise undamaged box was ripped in several places. My wife and I managed to scoop it into gallon plastic bags for storage in the fridge. This will not prevent me from ordering again, but . . . . Please do something about the shipping container.",positive
"Bought this at the suggestion of Julie Piatt in Plantpower Way cookbook. Great stuff, I really do enjoy the taste of this more than table salt. In addition, sea salt contains electrolytes like magnesium and other trace minerals that promote healthy immune system and thyroid function.",positive
"Nothing beats these flips! Great flavor, love the crumble to add to the yogurt and topping it with fruit makes it all awesome!",positive
"This was a great fruitcake, exactly as shown.",positive
Love that I don’t have to go to the store for smaller size containers. I use these to make pickles and are fresh with an awesome dill smell! I will definitely buy again!,positive
Best coffee ever!  My entire extended family now drinking it as well.,positive
Product was exactly as described. It arrived on time and included the personalization as requested.,positive
This has been my favorite muffin mix for many years. It makes a great cake as well. Try it with streusel topping. Yum!!!,positive
"100 cups for $30? The price is amazing for the quantity you get. At first, I was hesitant to purchase because it was so cheap that I thought the quality would be horrible. But I was wrong. I'm not a sophisticated coffee drinker by any means, but when the pod started going, it released a nice strong aroma into the air (something my Starbucks pods does), the taste wasn't too strong or nonexistent- it was a good balance in between, and it did its job of supplying me caffeine. Nothing else I can ask for in a coffee k cup. A good purchase would buy again.",positive
"Great product, and I’ll buy it again and again!",positive
"My son’s favorite, had them shipped to him as a stocking stuffer gift. He was thrilled.",positive
"I love the taste of this sauce, I use it on meats or on crackers with cheese.  It has a little bit of ""kick"" but not too much.",positive
Disgusting.... In the garbage.,negative
"When I got my package it was all melted and wouldn't break apart, not to mention stale.",negative
Awesome...  best coffee I've ever drank...,positive
"It is subtle, but if you brew this tea for five minutes there is a definite warm ginger flavor along with hints of herbal rosemary. The rosemary is not overpowering. With a little honey and a packet of stevia this is delicious. I made myself some tonight and thought it was a nice tea for the fall and winter. I'd say this is really a rosemary and ginger tea. I used two teaspoons of tea in two of those T sacs. Just brew it long enough for the ginger flavor to appear! Happy Holidays!~The Rebecca Review",positive
"I don’t like milk that isn’t cow’s milk, but this is good. I got it to put in my coffee because I tried a drink at Starbucks that uses oat milk. This is wonderful in my coffee and I’m surprised that I also like it by itself. It’s rich and creamy and gets the job done.",positive
Our twins love these puffs. The flavors are delicious but I wish there were other options as well. Its cheaper buying on amazon in this pack than it is at the store. I started giving them to my twins around 7 months with only 1-2 bottom teeth present and they had no problem eating them. Their face lights up when they see the puffs container!,positive
The spices are both sweet and spicy and the NO SALT is great from people with sodium restricted diets. I use this and other NO Salt spices on virtually everything that needs to have a 'kick' of flavor.,positive
"Not something I can buy all the time but when I have it, pretty much goes on everything!  This is a thick pureed like consistency of truffles and oil.  Mix to combine before each use and then spreads or spoons easily.  It doesn't stay fresh for ever so remember to use it up!  I wish I could accurately describe truffle flavor.  I was surprised when I first tried it because I thought it tasted like garlic, but not.  It's earthy, meaty, garlic and so much more.  Recommend looking it up for someone's qualified description :)",positive
"Whoa!  This stuff is bad!  How can this product sell?  There is something very, very wrong with the taste of the broth.  Like the other reviewers, my family and I took three spoonfuls and chucked it down the garbage disposal--yuck!",negative
Lacked in taste,negative
The best hot sauce I’ve ever had. I can’t eat without it now. Put it on everything! Blows the flavor out of this world on a sandwich,positive
"Other dole fruit cups DO NOT HAVE THE NUTRITIONAL LABEL, Just the ingredients listed.  So I missed reading on this product Before ORDERING.  20 Grams of ADDED SUGAR,,,,,,,Not what I would like,,,,, ALMOST A 12oz Soft Drink,,,,,,to much Sugar is a major Problem in today's diet causing disease, ie, diabetes, heart problems, obesity,  children getting type 2 diabetes Etc..  I think Amazon Should show right up top when offering foods the Nutritional Information so the buyer is not surprised.All the other ingredients are healthy foods, until ALL the sugar Added.Think Twice before an Order is placed...................................Karen",negative
Love this to make chicken tenders for the family! Oh and they're keto,positive
One of the worst things I've ever had. I'm a HUGE  pickled sausages fan and these have got to be single handedly the worst company I've ever tried. I also love picked eggs and theirs are so bad I couldn't even find a way to salvage them. Just... What happened?,negative
Great product and you can't beat the price.,positive
"This is a delicious, smooth coffee that would rank right in the middle in strength.  It holds up well compared to many other bands I've tried. that have often disappointed by being weak or overly strong ..  It certainly doesn't cheat you when it comes to caffeine,. If you can deal with coffee nerves or enjoy your daily jolt  you'll love it.  To deal with this , I alternate my Starbucks with a popular and flavorful organic decaf and that keeps me on an even keel . This has become one of my favorite brands  that I plan to reorder on a regular basis..  .",positive
The mixture of chocolate & coconut flavored coffee tastes every bit as good as it sounds.  The price is the best I have seen for flavored coffee in a while.  I rate this 5 *****.,positive
Delicious candy if you like pineapple.,positive
The choices of flavors are great!,positive
I liked it! great ea!,positive
Came promptly and tastes great! Esp love the cucumber mint! Thanks! Am pregnant myself and was sick of the fake dyes and syrup'y flavor of the store bought water enhancers. This is just what I was looking for! Like the new cap!,positive
Tastes like the perfect pecan pie with a consistency similar to honey.,positive
"As in the title line my family is fussy about their food so I was a bit surprised at the reaction the first time I made this wonderful dish. They liked it so much that asked me to make it for All of my family for Thanksgiving, and I'm so glad I did! It was the biggest hit of the day (besides the turkey) of course. It's so easy to make and even make it as a main course by adding your favorite ingredients, ham,broccoli, ect.I will not be without it now as a staple. So yes I very much recommend this yummy product!!",positive
My Favorite flavor.,positive
"Very enjoyable shopping, this is not the first time to buy chocolate online.  But it gave me a surprise. Because of the hot weather, the merchant used an ice bag incubator to express it to me. When I received the chocolate, it was still iced. This is great!  Will frequent in the future.",positive
"This wasn't sealed like it was new, it just taped shut like it was previously opened and they just didn't want it to leak.  It was wasted $14+ because I'm just throwing it out and buying something at the store.",negative
Delicious coffee in recyclable pods from a company that really cares about its customers as well as its farmers. I highly recommend them to all my family and friends.,positive
"Similar to others reviews, it was beautiful when it arrived, now 3 months later it is almost dead, infested with spider mites.",negative
Wow. I was floored with the amount of leaves in a one pound bag.  Have ground some for use in my morning drink.There is a lot of big stems included that got past the quality eyeballs,positive
These are a great treat to have on hand for a quick bite.  The bites themselves are very small but pack a good punch.  If you love hemp hearts then you will love these.  These have a nice nutty flavor and a bit of crunch to them and then get chewy as you get into the piece.  There is a good amount in the bag and are great to throw in your lunch for an afternoon pick me up or just eat them when you need a better snacking option.,positive
Love this. It is the only one I will ever buy. It is on the thick side and sweet flavor.,positive
"I was watching a cooking show where a very old Southern Grandma was showing her granddaughter how she makes her biscuits since there was no recipe, it was all in her head and measurements were guessed at but the key thing she was using was a flour with shortening or butter flakes in it. I have a very hard time finding this until discovering this brand and it makes the absolutely  most delicious biscuits with so little effort. As long as you don't overwork the dough or overcook them, there is virtually nothing you can do to make these biscuits not taste wonderful. I have made them for people a few times and have gotten rave reviews of some of the best biscuits they have ever had. They are light and fluffy with a delicious buttery richness. I highly recommend brushing the tops with butter just as they come out of the oven. Heaven.",positive
"This tastes really nice, despite use of sweeteners , no strange aftertaste of any kind, tastes like real chocolate, good job guys!",positive
"I wanted to update some pictures, because after all the broken candy cane spoons, I think the company has permanently fixed their packaging issue! None of my spoons came broken, and they all taste just like regular candy canes like you would expect. They’re super cute! I Purchased them for my daughter to use them with hot cocoa bombs!",positive
"I was very disappointed to find that my ""Monkfruit with erythriol"" was actually ""Erythriol with monkfruit."" The ingredients list shows that there is more erythriol than monkfruit. Very deceptive advertising from a company that claims to be interested in helping people ""discover chi."" Chi-zeee!!!",negative
"The seeds are a little too salty for my tastes, I realized that the salt seemed to settle to the bottom and so started shaking the seeds in a wire strainer and a lot of the salt came out making them just right for me.",positive
These cookies are delicious and not just for Christmas time.,positive
"I appreciate organic foods and clearly I’m willing to pay a higher price for quality. However, this product is priced several dollars too high for popcorn.  It is a good popcorn and I am a repeat customer but sadly I never recommend without a buyer-beware price warning.",positive
"A delicious, colorful, healthy flavor addition to many dishes--especially rice and dips.  It arrived promptly and is nice and fresh.",positive
"Packaging did not state gluten free, called customer service who said they would resend.  Still not gluten free.  Now state gluten free is unavailable but still advertised. The one I received has caramel color and no gluten free description.  Be careful before you try to buy!",negative
"Fruitcake.  You either love it or hate it.  I love I, and can only find it online after the holiday decorations are packed away.",positive
This was our first time trying to water glass about 40 fresh chicken eggs. It was easy to do. Apparently water glessing fresh eggs they can last 18 months or more. Stored in dark cabinet. We will see.,positive
Just love the taste.,positive
"This is my favorite gluten free bread crumb product.  I like the texture, it melds well with a little butter for a fish topping etc.  Price wise, I do feel it's a little expensive, but I am careful with portion size so it works for me.",positive
"I bought this for my granddaughters first birthday. Her name is Aimee. When I received this cake topper I was disappointed to say the least because it does not look like her name. The ""A"" and ""I"" are literally touching each other which makes it hard to make out her name. I tried to return it, but Amazon says I can't return it. I wish it would let you view the product before you are stuck with a cake topper that you can't use.",negative
Best cookies I have ever eaten!! They just literally melt in your mouth!!,positive
Take a cool evening and luxuriate in this luscious drink. It's so easy to make and is the creamiest instant product I've tried.  Great stuff.,positive
I do a lot of gluten-free baking and I love this potato starch.,positive
The yogurt covered almonds are very tasty.  I like the thick coating.  Even more impressive was the packaging.  They came with a full outside wrapping of foil insulation with each individual package foil insulated.  I assume this was to help prevent melting.  In any case it was well done.,positive
"Was disappointed with the quality and taste of the gourmet cookies. The cookies looked beautiful but were very mediocre in regards to taste. The chocolates used in the cookies were not quality  choices, did not have that unctuous taste of very good chocolate. The variety looked good but they all tasted the same regardless of indicated flavor.",negative
I love these I will be ordering more soon,positive
I bought this for my husband because he is very particular when it comes to his coffee flavor. You get a very nice Quantity of coffee for the price. We will order more and possibly and some different flavors. It is definitely cheaper than going to Starbucks which I absolutely love and so does he.,positive
I use it for sugarfree desserts.,positive
I love this honey. It is so delicious.,positive
"These small cans somehow always arrive in bits. Maybe 1/4 of each can whole chips. They should probably fill the cans a little more. These really feel like a rip off arriving so broken. They also seem over priced, even if unbroken.",negative
The plant arrived with broken stems and browned leaves and was beyond reviving. Do not buy.,negative
"Excellent crema, smooth strong taste. Works very well with automatic espresso machine.",positive
These things are the best! I started selling them at my school and they are selling like hot cakes. They are really sweet and usually never too sour;however one thing to watch out for is keeping it in the heat. If its too hot it gets really chewy and hard. My customers at my high school didnt like that so i had to keep them cool.,positive
"Not expensive and tests great,",positive
"Very impressed with this snack box. Every item I opened had really good flavor, perfect for a Christmas gift to someone with celiac or a gluten intolerance. I received everything that was said to  be in it. Will be sure to buy this again.",positive
"Excellent product, definitely recommended.",positive
Healthy and also tastes good! Dissolves very easily in hot water.,positive
I love this! I love eating salad and this makes a great addition to any dressing. The chunks are pretty big.,positive
"I was at a friend's house and nibbled on a bunch of these crackers, not realising they contained MSG.. next morning I was into a full-blown MS relapse and could actually TASTE the darned stuff! The last time this happened was after a meal at a news Mexican restaurant in 2012. It transpired that some of their seasonings contained MSG.. sigh..",negative
My favorite. I like on my yogurt and in my chai tea,positive
Good for your digestive system.,positive
Taste and beauty of a flower in water,positive
A short comment about the difference between the suger-free and the regular. The regular dissolves easily in hot water but the suger-free is a light powder that floats on top and takes some stirring to dissolve. I am a type 2 diabetic and have found that the sugar-free actually makes me feel hungry and craving food shortly after drinking it. Not good. I monitor my glucose and have found that I can drink a cup or two of the regular without elevating my sugar much. Regular also tastes better. Regular has only 80 calories and sugar-free has 15 calories.,positive
Easy to spread and I wished the bottles lasted me longer. Yum!,positive
This is my new favorite coffee. I’ll buy it again.,positive
Loved the flavor and freshness of nuts and chocolate.,positive
Easy directions to follow,positive
"We've been buying the the Sumatran for several years now and really appreciate the consistency of the product.  It's a good, bold Sumatran that stores well, has quick shipping and always seems to be available.  The only gripe I have is that the price has slowly risen over time.  It does make me want to search for an alternative, but only due to price.  Otherwise, we have no reason to switch.",positive
"Great product, I was spending a fortune buying the little bags of these at the local coffee shop.  Now I have a supply at home and work.  I've had several people at work ask where I got them from so hopefully you will get more sales!",positive
"The larger size is harder to find now and has gone up in price, but you can buy packets",positive

It's a great gluten free rice noodle  for my asian soups! I wish that it was less expensive.,positive
"I lost almost a full bottle of my item, the cover and seal was not done properly, Evey thing was a mess when I got it.",negative
My only issue was that the prongs were too long for my cake and I resolved it by just cutting them off shorter and it stood up and looked great!,positive
I love this coffee! I was looking for something that was cheap but had good flavor and I definitely found it in this coffee!,positive
"Absolutely delicious and high quality salt,",positive
"TV is shite,thank god for youtube",neutral
I cannot believe this is sugar free. It's absolutely delicious.  Can't have too many in a row though. It does Have malitol in it and I won't tell you what that does.  You can Google.  But it's super tasty.  Very good licorice taste.  Like a licorice bear.  Very fresh. Very soft.  Mmm will buy again.,positive
Who doesn’t like vanilla ice cream!! Yum ! I was on a sundae kick for awhile and had to have this in my freezer every time!!,positive
Couldn’t find these locally had to try them.  Love them,positive
Love it can't find it at the grocery stores anymore,positive
Lots of nuts great taste fast shipping,positive
"Best shelf stable flavor chocolate milk. Kids love it and it is hard to find a good dairy free chocolate milk these days, especially one that doesn't have to go in the fridge right away. Excellent for school lunches and long car rides.",positive
Perfect soup when on a high protein sugar free diet. I also like the oatmeal they make for my breakfast.,positive
YUM yum and yum,positive
If you want an infused exotic tea....this is the one to order! I am no longer a coffee enthusiast....After drinking this tea I am now a tea enthusiast. This tea is awesome and love the cocoa mint chill taste and vibes. This tea is great unsweetened or sweetened with stevia. It’s very exotic to my tastebuds! I will order more very soon and thank you for this awesome tea. Don’t ever stop making it!,positive
"Well, I bought this for my job and then they laid me off.  They refused to take requests, but the sample I had was so good I wanted more.  The French Roast and Italian Roast the company had tons of was giving me a headache, and this helped.  Had no idea I was gonna be canned the following week.",negative
"Considering how everyone is accustomed to Maruchan brand (I was practically raised on it) this is a tasty departure. This chicken flavor is delicious and if you can find the Cheese flavor Samyang Bulldark, you gotta try that as well.",positive
My wife was German born and misses her German made bread.  This was GREAT.  She loved it and couldn't wait to cut a slice.,positive
"Ugh, I was so hopeful about this chili oil crisp. I’ve tried plenty of other brands and love them. Had read about this one being the OG, so wanted to give it a shot, but EWWWW. Weird off fishy flavor. I’m not sure if it’s the brand, or just this batch… but yuck. Had to throw it out. WASTE OF MONEY",negative
"Sadly, those were dry and shriveled.  Ended up in the bin.",negative
"These are not the normal sized Wispas as the description would have you believe. Don’t be fooled and don’t waste your money, these things are tiny",negative
I have eatin this for a few year now and Buffalo Bob's is one of the best in the country.  You can't go wrong with Buffalo Bob's no matter what you order.  I have not found one item I don't enjoy...there all great.,positive
Great buy if you can make the investment! This bag lasted me almost a year.,positive

My kids love it and it came early so I ordered some for myself. This product is worth the wait.,positive
"Soft, mushy and has no garlic taste at all.  Just taste vinegary.",negative
"Nice bite size, best tasting chocolate covered marshmallows ever. Excellent packaging keeps them fresh",positive
Did not like that it only tastes like garlic.,negative
worst crackers ever. it's true what other reviewers say-the crackers taste rancid and the texture is awful worse or at least as bad as sawdust. :(,negative
"As usual...big corporation buys a company out and ruins there product to create more profit.  All this Bridge Mixture consists of now is some chocolate covered nuts and raisins.  Gone are the Turkish delight, the irish and other cremes, and the long lasting caramels.  I have spoke to Hershey about this and they don't care.  So Hershey can now do without any of my money ever again.",negative
Such good quality and price! Pods work perfectly with the Nespresdo!,positive
ive finished them now,neutral
"I ordered these to put on my frozen pizzas. Like many say, these are not the anchovies like we get on pizzas. But these are the best anchovies I've ever had on a pizza. Also good with pasta. I was disappointed at first, but these are great. Not as salty as pizza anchovies. These are whole so larger. But I think they work fine. I will be ordering more of these. Plus Wild Planet catches stuff in the proper manner.",positive
Just YUM!Rice is so much better with a little dash of this.,positive
"The first cup I made was overwhelmingly sweet, it was not my favorite. My husband described it as “hot fruit sugar water”. BUT for the second cup I only used one tbsp of tea (to 8oz water) and it was so much better. It’s a very light flavored, sweetened tea. Very fruity and refreshing, but seriously starting with only 1 tbsp of tea!",positive
This is great. It's like Trader Joes!,positive
Fast shipping.  Just as expected.,positive
"I have only used the cinnamon twice, but noticed that the flavor was both strong and flavorfull.  I think that I am going to love this product with the holiday baking season ahead of me.",positive
"I really like this pancake mix.  It needs only water added, and produces consistently good pancakes.  Thanks!",positive
I love this dressing. The flavor is delicious (if you like vinegar &oil) It makes eating salads more frequently a joy!,positive
"It's not that complicated, I brewed this tea and it had a very strong, moldy dirt smell that was a big turn-off. I tasted it nonetheless, and guess what? It tasted like dirt too. This isn't the very worst of it. The worst of it all is that the seller doesn't accept refunds. So I'm stuck with this dirt-tea which is pretty much useless to me. I was satisfied with Prince of Peace's Oolong tea though.",negative
"is exactly as pictured, does it’s job!",positive
"Bought one years ago at local store for on the go with the kids.  Recently started to use in my husbands lunch box.  His co-workers liked them so we ordered a 3 pack.  Apparently they are discontinued, so snatch them online while you can.",positive
"Love this coffee.  I am not a fan of strong or bitter coffee. This one is perfect for waking me in the mornings.  It compares to Dunkin Donuts, which is another good one.",positive
"NOT AS ADVERTISED! Some tea crumbs instead or loose leaf? Also package came damaged, do not process returns....((",negative
Make this everyday in my programmable coffee pot so it is ready in the morning when I wake up. I use a sugar free creamer and love it. I also use it to add flavor to cake and other things by replacing the water with brewed CriBru.,positive
This is the 2nd gallon I purchased in the last month and both bottles arrived spoiled. Although the date indicated the product was good....still bad,negative
"I’ve ordered this product before and really liked it. This time around though i was not happy. It was delivered on Monday and tonight, Thursday when I went to have some there was mold on it.  Not happy!",negative
Excellent refreshing finish!,positive
This gift made my sister in law smile. Certainly a great gift to get a smile from a coffee lover.,positive
i would buy this product again,positive

This tea tastes great and was good for an upset stomach.  Will buy again!,positive
I love the flavor! It’s just the right amount of sweetness. I am definitely  ordering again.,positive
This is what I imagine brake fluid tastes like,negative
Love these crackers and that they are sold by themselves.  I can’t find anywhere except in a variety pack with other things.  Fast shipping!  Thank you!,positive
Tastes so good. I don’t understand why these are so much more than other brands of coffee. Wish they costs less. But it’s cheaper than Starbucks!,positive
"Love these dumplings! I typically buy a huge bag of  the brand they carry at Costco or BJ's .. but won't do that after having these. These cook up so beautifully , the filling is flavorful and tender.. and while smaller than the Big Box brands..worth the price difference.  Target.. please carry the largest size bag you can !",positive
"I love the tiny bears and the tiny bags, they are a perfect ""snack attack"".  They are really cute; I kee them in a basket at my desk for employees and they always bring s smile to people's faces.",positive
I purchased this item because it look the same as the one I bought before but it is a much smaller package and this item is not eligible for return (I was very surprised because this is the very first item I bought on Amazon that is not eligible for return. Just FYI !! ),negative
The best KETO friendly and best tasting salsa on the market! Cost friendly as well! Loved this salsa!,positive
I bought this game for my cousins and nieces for this summer. We have not had a chance to play it yet but I brought some to work and have gotten several people with these. Can't wait to play this summer with my family.,positive
"This has become a required item in our house. Between burgers, eggs, and anything in between, we can’t get enough of the flavor.",positive
"This date syrup is a bit hit at home. It is so versatile and delicious. We use it on yogurt, to make granola bars, to bake chicken and other meats, to spread on toast and cereals... it tastes great on just about anything! This is pure date syrup, no added sugar or oils. It is considered as a healthy sweetener. Though I still love honey too!",positive
"I’ve bought this product a lot and the “fill line” in the plastic containers was quite visible. These new cardboard containers don’t seem to have one at all, at least not that I can see. I tried to guess based on where I remember it used to be, but I guessed too much, the thing overflowed all over my microwave and turned out too “soupy”. Also, I noticed a change in the taste. It seemed to have a subtle “cardboardy” taste as if particles of the cardboard were coming off on the noodles. Yuck. I won’t be buying this in this packaging again.",negative
"Tastes Strange,Not what you are thinking it will taste like!!!",negative
"One of the very few Medium roasts I have purchased, (I've tried a lot) that was medium roast brown colored beans that were not glossy oozing with oil. The way to tell that someone knows how to roast medium roast is if the beans are nice brown matte looking which these are. Will be ordering them again. If you use a super automatic machine like a Saeco Intellia, your machine wants beans like these because they don't clog the brew unit with a oily sticky mess. A+ product here.",positive
"I'm not big on seafood, but my step-son tried this on white fish and absolutely loved it. We've since used it on several types of meat including chicken, pork, and beef. All have which come out great. Overall it provides a really fantastic flavor profile and adds a good amount of flavoring which most of my dry rubs never do. Highly recommended!",positive
Mmm deliciosos,positive
Only 9 pieces of candy and it was melted.  could've gotten a 30 piece bag for the price from local storeLearn from my mistakes,negative

"For coffee, usually prefer coffeemate creamer. This has a chemical aftertaste, had to pitch the cup of coffee. Black tastes better!Guess we will throw it all away, disappointing.",negative
"my daughter and I like mulled cider and we drink it often especially around holidays.  I bought this and prepared it for her and she turned it away saying it burned her throat.  I thought that was an exaggeration and tried it myself. It was terrible.  Harsh, burning, no flavor.  I intend to send it back.",negative
I thought I ordered Priester's but these came instead.  They are no where near the quality of Priester's.,negative
Absolutely love this balsamic reduction!  It is the best tasting one and does not burn your stomach or make your salad watery.,positive
"I tried to cancel this order, they did not work with me toward this.....So now I have 3 bags, 7 dollars a pop for baked chips that are not even that good....Be better with customer service!",negative
This is one of my “comfort coffees” and great to have around. I drink it as espresso and was happy to stumble across it in the island last year. The price is kinda ridiculous but what can you do?,positive
So awesome...so happy,positive
Arrived a day early! I got exactly what I expected!  My husband loved them,positive
We love Cliff bars and this flavor is one of the better ones. You really can compare it to a healthy oatmeal cookie. The texture is softer and more chewy than the average granola bar. It's organic so that's a nice plus. I'm not too worried about it having sugar since I don't load my kids up with sweets otherwise so this is a good snack that's in-between healthy and sweet.,positive
the candy was old and you could not see the salt. it must have been setting around a long time. or it had been frozen. i will not by again through amazon,negative
_FP Awh shoot. Make a detour and come to PR  forget Indiana haha,neutral
Use product for breakfast by adding an egg and extra virgin olive oil.,positive
This is a good tea overall at least  for health benefits. I had some concerns after my 1st taste. I didn't notice (taste) peppermint much. It wasn't a strong smell (aroma) or strong (noticeable) flavor.,negative
Both of my kids love this flavor! My 2 year old asks for them and she's in a pretty picky phase.,positive
"Tastes ok, but way too sweet for peanut butter. Why the added sugar?Peanut butter already has plenty of oil from the *peanuts*. Why is there added oil?Peanut butter should contain at most two ingredients: peanuts & salt.",negative
This is my go to salmon. It grills up nicely and always tastes fresh.,positive
These cookies are fresh and pumpkin spice delicious!,positive
"So when I opened these I found it to have such a weird smell that I didn't dare use.I thought the smell would dissipate but it hasn't in a few months, so I will simply throw these away.Sad for us.  I bought these because I thought this gum was a better option than those with artificial sweeteners.",negative
AND I really like the re-seal packaging.I use daily for cooking and in health drinks. I look forward to trying their other products and I will certainly re-order Turmeric.,positive
Taste and Quality!,negative
yummy coffee great value ..fast shipment,positive
Not actually allulose.  Check the ingredients.  It's 20% allulose and 80% ethrytol,negative
My first Paleo buy won't be my last!! These things taste like snoballs!! Amazing flavor! I put them in freezer and they thawed well too!!! Just wonderful!,positive
Cool.,positive
"These are amazing. Filling, delicious and healthy. Personal favorite bar out of everything that's out there.I've ordered this item 7-8 times and they've always been on time and very fresh. I prefer the almond butter flavor slightly over the chocolate chip, but they're both great!",positive
"These Marcona almonds are excellent and first quality.  However, they are available from COSTCO for $7.99 (East Coast market).  You'd be foolish to pay anything more than that.  Kirkland is the COSTCO house brand.",positive
Very reasonable price. Great product. Just wish the v8 company didn't wrap each 8-pack in plastic. Seems unnecessary.Do appreciate no added sugar!,positive
Great scobi that produced amazing kombucha in the first batch!,positive
Very satisfied with taste of this product.,positive
I love this stuff. It's super creamy with that kick of spice. I put it on everything almost.,positive
"I really like the smell of these seeds. The smell releases after they have been ground andit is so lemon-y and light. I use a coffee grinder (not used for coffee), and it is not the perfectpowder but it tastes just the same. Saved so much comparing to buying coriander spiceat Whole Foods spices section.",positive
Love this olive oil. Have purchased numerous bottles and will continue. The best!,positive
Got them for my mother for a birthday present. She loved them.,positive
Flavorful and tender. Very good value.,positive
Mom is addicted to them that I have to wait two months before I send her another. She's 92.,positive
Organic and taste very good.Looks pale because it has no added color or flavor.,positive
My kids & I love Slim Jims so.imagine our disappointment when we open the box and the first and only THREE we take out are old and stale. They nearly take on the consistency of petrified wood. I took a bite to see if maybe there was just a color variance....NOPE - old as tree bark. Definitely disappointed!,negative
"After buying this item a couple of times and enjoying the product, studies were released thathave stated the more studies have to be done as to the safety of Erythritol... what makes this product taste sweet and yummy.  I just received a bag and wanted to return it.  No returns allowed.  Until more studies are more conclusive either way I am no longer buying products that have Erthritol.",negative
This is so much fluffier than most wheat alternative flours I've used.  I love it!!,positive
"My boyfriend adores these, he even liked the turkey one (which is a miracle in and of itself as he hates turkey) I’ll probably be buying more soon!",positive
love the thai chili tuna - slightly spicy and really good.  really convenient in the pouch for lunches.  i eat this stuff regularly when i am on a cutting diet.,positive
Found out about this NO carb sweetener from a low carb recipe. Packets have 1 carb each because of filler used. When low carbing I can't afford any extra carbs. I can't go above inductions 20 carbs a day and still lose weight. That's not many for the day! I love this. I keep one in the kitchen and one in my purse.,positive
Use this in my daily shakes. Tastes great and dissolves perfectly. Highly recommended. A lot more convenient and cheaper than buying regular coconut milk.,positive
Great as seasoning on top of food not as broth,positive
Good to thumbs up,positive
"This is one of my favorite energy drinks. The strawberry sublime flavor is great and it’s calorie-free. It has a good caffeine content to get your day going. The packaging on it isn’t the worst, but it does cause some cans to come in dented.",positive
I like the texture. Course but not too large perfect size.,positive
This arrived fast and fresh. I love the gingerbread Kit Kats. I bought these for Christmas fillable gifts and this is perfect.,positive
This is so good!!! It went far beyond my expectations. It’s more garlicky than spicy but the flavor is wonderful. Bought to put in homemade ramen. Very happy with it!,positive
Flavor and freshness is great! Even my child who hates anything new loved it.,positive
"Great taste, can't stand pieces in my teeth",positive
"I use Sriracha like ketchup! It goes on everything!! Sure, once in a while I go over the top and put too much on my food, but I power through and build my tolerance, so next time I could pile more on my plate!And 12 bottles for $17.99 is an amazing deal!",positive
The most natural tasting of the stevia suite out there,positive
Good taste whether you want it strong of weak.,positive
This is an expensive product. I don’t buy it to sweeten my tea but rather for its medicinal properties. It seems to kill bacteria on contact. I have used effectively on fire ant bites and a gum infection.,positive
Pricey but goid,positive
Some good butter,positive
Wonderful coffee. Makes the smoothest cold brew with great flavor. Love it for my at home quarantine coffees!,positive
"They have coffees that fit anyones taste from light to expresso,crema etc. wonderful product.",positive
The kids I gave this to were very impressed -- and they're teenagers.  Their mom said they taste really good and were nicely wrapped.  Thank you!,positive
"As always, Eight O'Clock coffee is the best and these K-cups are great.  My husband is the hazelnut lover. These have just the right amount of hazelnut flavor, not overpowering, the great 8 o'clock coffee.  This will become a regular purchase for our household.",positive
I tried spearmint & peppermint. Flavors are ok. Not amazing. The gum itself deteriorates quickly & has a sticky/slimy texture. Only can chew for a minute or two before spitting it out. Will keep looking for a better natural gum.,negative
"I expected this to have an odd flavor cause of the mushrooms but it tastes pretty much like a regular coffee. Less acidic and a tiny bit ""light"" in taste but not in a watery type of way which makes it a good daily cup with no CONS",positive
I have been a consumer of Pappy's choice seasonings for over a decade.  i recommend this as highly as I can.  This is the most awesome savory seasoning there is.  The prime rib rub is outstanding as is the regular Pappy's seasoning.,positive
"We drank this coffee each morning at our hotel during visit to Santa Fe last summer.  Loved it!  After finding out what it was we bought three lbs at their local Whole Foods store (ironic), flew it back, and once we ran out back in NC, ordered more online from the NM Pinon Coffee Company, 5 lbs a pop to get free shipping.  I wasn't wild about buying that much as I like fresh beans, but shipping costs for 2 lbs was horrendous. Shipping, free or not, also tended to be unreliable (three weeks on one occasion, lost in transit on another). So when I found Amazon sold 2 lb bags on Prime, free shipping, delivered in 2 days, it was a great match.  Needless to say, we love the coffee, make a pot every morning, and when we do on occasion try something new, we have both been disappointed regardless its price or reputation. Also makes decent expresso.",positive
The BEST coconut water! I reorder anytime they are in stock.,positive
"It will satisfy the craving for hops, but it was not as refreshing as plain water, and it was not as satisfying as a beer.  :)",negative
I love how it mixes in my coffee each morning and doesn't leave that cocoa sludge that regular off the shelf cocoa at supermarkets do. It makes it chocolate-y and sweet enough without me adding sugar to my coffee.,positive
This is our favorite stir fry sauce!,positive
Great product and wonderful service.,positive
"We picked this one out first but was skeptical after reading some of the reviews. Finally we were down to the wire and hadn't found anything else we liked, so I ordered this and hoped for the best. I absolutely love it!!! It doesn't look cartoonish at all. It is a little heavy but would definitely buy it again.",positive
"Absolutely perfect. They came well packaged, all about the same size, and in excellent condition. Not a blemish or bruise. I will definitely order again.",positive
great flavor great value,positive
Fantastic delicious soup !!!!!  Everyone else where I live must think so too - because I can never find it !!!!,positive
Best treat to have at home,positive
Goes great with yogurt! Also great straight out of the bag.,positive
"I bought two of these to give as gifts for my niece’s birthdays. They absolutely loved them. They were packed well, nothing was broken. Each package had the same items, which I was fine with. The items were fresh and there was a good variety. Nothing in the individual bag was a duplicate item. This was a fun gift option that I will definitely keep in mind for other occasions.",positive
"[[VIDEOID:f7346f87f9897bba9183e0bbe5fbb748]] I like this a lot more than some of the more traditional stuff you'd find in the store.  Each item only has a handful of ingredients and it's all things you've heard of before.  There's no chemicals or unnecessary ingredients.  The Sea Salt and Truffle versions are vegan and the Cheese Balls are presumably vegetarian, though they do list ""enzymes"" as an ingredient which can be plant-based or derived from animal sources, so best to check if you have any concerns.  The taste of all three is great.  I genuinely like all of them.  They're pretty clean and don't leave your hands feeling like they're covered in oil.  The popcorn itself is physically small, so some may have an issue with that, but it doesn't bother me.  (See attached video for a look inside each bag.)  Overall, I'm really happy with these and would definitely buy them again",positive
Excellent chocolate. Nice box if you want to give them as a gift. I will reorder.,positive
"Did not see that these were labeled ""quick 3-minute.""If you have ever wanted to try Elmer's School Glue with some sandblasting grit mixed in, by all means, buy this.Otherwise, no.",negative
see headline. no further comment,negative
"I love that these are lower in sugar than regular preserves.  Way too much sugar in that. This product has a great taste, it's still sweet, and I even use it to top cheesecake along with fresh strawberries.They could make it better if they added more fruit, and took away even more sugar.",positive
These chips were so burnt you could not even taste their usual flavor. I ordered 6 bags each bag contained burnt chips. Ugh!  Don’t buy these. They are rejects!,negative
See attached pic—Great taste but it's a challenge to enjoy when its been smashed into crumbs. Hoping Julian bakery will switch to sturdy boxes and NOT bubble wrap USPS envelopes that are crammed into a standard mailbox.,negative
Farro swaps out with rice and cooks in about the same amount of time.  The difference is the chewy nature of the grain.  My family enjoys that texture so we intend to keep this in the pantry.,positive
Its a lovely coffee from the Southern India intact with a lovely mocha-like aroma. It is made of Arabica beans and blended with chicory  (soap nut) - a blend unique to South India.This arrived in a good condition but was expensive on Amazon. I would recommend going to a local Asian store or buying it elsewhere.,positive
Out of two one is broken. Can’t return,negative
They may break your teeth.  They are expensive and not returnable,negative
"My usual chili recipe calls for 1/4 cup chili powder. I definitely don't need to use that much with this powder, can probably cut it down to 1 tbsp, as it's a potent chili powder. Nice to be able to save a bit.",positive
We stopped buying delivered pizza after ordering sag-instant yeast; with this product it is very easy to quickly make an excellent pizza crust that we prefer over commercially-made pizzas. Also works well for cinnamon rolls using the same recipe minus oil. Such a great deal over buying the small 3-packs in the supermarket. Transfer to a plastic container after first use and store in refrigerator.,positive
My husband loved this tea. Excellent taste. Next tome will order the green tea,positive

"This product was ordered because it is an emergency food source. I won't open it unless we have an emergency. It is canned for use up to 25 years. If I open it now, I lose the shelf life. Nutristore has a good reputation and I am hoping that my trust will be warranted. We live in a very rural area, where we could face longer power outages than more populated areas.",positive

I LOVE THIS BEEF JERKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the second time I have ordered and both times i got it on time. The jerky is the best in the world. It is the only one I have tasted that lets me know that I am eating beef jerky not sugar syrup  jerky.I took some to work and my whole bag was gone by then end of the day.Thanks a bunch for the delicious treats,positive
I didn't realize I had already ordered when I  ordered it again. Your guidance on how to handle lthis was much appreciated,positive
"I dont like the flavor of regular Sriracha but this stuff is way different.  It adds an actual flavor and some heat without being overbearing.  Its kind of sweet - works well on breakfast burritos or anything else really.  The sweetness makes it a bit weird on things youd normally put hot sauce on like wings but its still very good IMO.  Ive bought several bottles over the last year or so and the only thing is the heat can be different from batch to batch.  Thats to be expected with 'small' batch stuff like this and is actually printed on the bottle.  Im not a pepper head but can tolerate moderate heat.  This stuff has never been overbearing or made me reverse blow (unless you drink a spoonful then its a bit spicy) and adds just a bit of heat.  We always have a dozen or so hot sauces on hand and while I do like some heat, I hate the stuff thats just hot without flavor.  I also hate the stuff thats so hot you have to reverse blow or need a drink or that leaves your mouth pouring out saliva non-stop.  That just makes it unenjoyable.  This stuff has flavor.  Ive tried almost all of their flavors and I like them all.  Their jalapeno is great and about the top of my heat level while still being enjoyable.  The habanero is pretty hot.  Tasty but only need a few drops.  Its borderline too hot for me especially if you squirt it on all over. That one starts to be just heat and no flavor for me at least.",positive
tried 3 bags and dont like the taste at all,negative
"Very, very, very sweet. Generally speaking, I don't like sweet food. Don't waste your money if you don't like sweet.",negative
"These are delicious and just what we wanted, just like The Hershey Store at Time Square.",positive

Best for my tastes over many years.,positive
"My kids call it chocolate peanut butter, they love it.  What I liked was how fresh and smooth the Nutella was. It was softer and more smooth at first opening than some that I have brought from grocery stores.",positive
"The five minute claim was a joke, it takes 5-10 min after water boils & then needs to sit in the hot water another 5-10 min, then cooled with cool running water. However, it was worth the wait. The texture was perfect & they taste exactly like the boba from the tea shop.",positive
"Amazing flavor, perfect addition to our morning routine!",positive
I liked the flavor!!,positive
Love this seasoning! It make anything taste like gold!,positive
This tea left me wanting more of whatever favor was supposed to be present.  I prefer Revolution brand lavender tea. Much better.,negative
I received a sample of this product and was pleasantly surprised. This pancake mix tastes great and is easy to prepare. I highly recommend it!,positive
Lover the packaging,positive
"I really enjoy these sparkling drinks. They are ideal for people who just want a taste of flavor - not as sweet as soda, but way better than flavored seltzer water.",positive
Sticks to popcorn great.,positive
Dislike because recipe calls for  using  beef for SWEDISH meatballs.Swedish meatball are made of combination of beef snd pork. No way do these  taste  like Swedish meatballs . I will not use the other 11 packets!  Very  disappointing  and  misrepresented  as Swedish.,negative

Very strange. I got the other 3 items I ordered from Amazon a week ago. This one came today and is short 5 boxes of Natures Bakery Brownie Bars.,negative
The flavor is very hard to describe. It’s really delicious tho. At first I wasn’t sure about it but the bag just got emptied and I’m immediately ordering more. I tapped the corners to get every crumble out. I didn’t realize how much it grown on me! 5/5 for sure. Excellent on everything I’ve tried it on.,positive
"Love the coffee, great price, came early!",positive
"It is great, thanks.",positive
The box did not look as good as advertised. Found out our local CVS offer similar product half priced.  Ask for return but rejected. It was a hasty purchase. Will never buy this again.,negative
Bananas?? Where can't taste any !! Will never buy this again - very disappointed,negative
I make milk tea a lot but I noticed a chemical smell from the typical Memri assam tea from the local grocery store.  I also started to feel sick and lethargic after drinking it and later learned that loose leaf assam tea tends to have a high pesticide count. So I looked for organic alternatives and this is the one I found on amazon. I been drinking it for two months now and let me say...you can taste the difference and no sick lethargic feeling afterwards too. A little goes a long way too.  Its only on Amazon though...you cant find it at Whole foods or Sprouts.,positive
This item was given as a gift. It was well received.  Almost as good as one's from my youth!,positive
"I'm always looking for something to add some zing to my barbecue.  I have a lot of different rubs and sauces, but none with a vinegar base.  I watched Malcolm Reed use this sauce on ribs and it intrigued me, so I ordered a bottle.  I made a pork tenderloin, rubbed with coffee and Cosmos Q Honey Killer Bees rub.  After grilling, and slicing, I drizzled this stuff on top.  Man oh man, it was fantastic.  Some of Malcolm's stuff is not that great, but this is worth trying.  I can't wait to try it on my next rack of ribs.",positive
Great to bake with. Not oily like shredded coconut. Not too strong of a coconut flavor.,positive
"Wish they sold them in stores. My favorite is sour cream 'n onion, one kid likes regular and the other kid likes salt and vinegar. Finding all three together in a variety pack is a real boon to the snack rack.",positive
Not satisfied with Chock full o'Nuts. Please send no more. Sargent,negative
Its like watery,negative
Unbelievable!!!  So fresh and juicy.  I am amazed that we got these in the winter.  I have already picked out my next 2 purchases. I think these will help get my daughter thru e-learning with her 2 boys.  🥰,positive
"Well truly it's a thing you can't just tell how its benefiting you as I have not method to see it but the quality it good. The stemps are long and the color cones out good. I boile it in milk with a Cardamom in it, the color and smell comes out great and taste is also lively. I think it's gonna help in long run, let's see.",positive
"Great product, taste like home made grape",positive
"Delish, strong, and not too salty. Happy, but overpriced.",positive
NOT WHAT I WANTED!,negative
"Does Jocko White Tea have magical healing properties? I can say, without a doubt, YES!!! Woke up in the middle of the night with severe pain in my ear. Went to the MD the next morning and had a raging ear infection (along with bronchitis). Prescribed me some antibiotics; but once I got home, I brewed up some Jocko White Tea. The pain went away, my sinuses cleared up, I was able to breath easier and had no more coughing. Coincidence? I think not! Buy this product NOW if you want to deadlift over 8,000 #'s, or need a boast in your health so you can keep kicking ass and getting after it!",positive
I love the taste of them in my coffee and my tea.  They add just enough sweetness and flavor that I like. Will buy again.,positive
i liked the selection and the chocolate tasted good,positive
"I have had an Amazon account since 2006 and this is only my 2nd review. The product and customer service are above and beyond excellent, so I felt compelled to share my experience and highly endorse the product :-)I have tried each flavor and love them all! There are so many great things about this product (and I am picky when it comes to diet—Whole Foods plant-based Vegan). The flavor, health benefits, locally sourced ingredients, and versatility stand out the most. Plus I adore the packaging!One time I received an expired pack from Amazon, and when I called Amazon they issued a refund. I also contacted the Lil Bucks company directly via email just as an FYI. I was not expecting to hear anything back since I did not make any specific requests or complaints; but more just wanted to give a friendly heads up. The CEO Emily got back to me immediately, and shared she would send some complimentary packs to me just for the trouble. Her and her company are a role model for excellent customer service, and I highly recommend!!",positive
Has an awesome flavor to them. Love the tins they come in.,positive
"Jacob's cream crackers,  one of the tastiest crackers there is.  I had these since my childhood days. Low in sodium, no sugar added, just tasty.",positive
[[VIDEOID:6cd548c39fbda975ac4538b4f214069c]] I like these alit! Love the nespresso that are not on plastic!,positive
"I like my coffee dark, smokey and strong, not overcomplicated and this simply hits the spot. It's good brewed hot, but especially tasty brewed ice.  Also really good price for a whole 2 lbs.",positive
Tastes like a coffee shop London fog! So delish,positive
Delicious! Super addicting.,positive
Read ingredients More sugar than anything else. Doesn’t taste like the real thing. Just tried it at The Reef restaurant in Ponte Vedra north of St Augustine. This is not what I tasted at all,negative
I love making pizza with these and it so easy to make your own. I went to my local Safeway and they were sold out and Amazon Fresh put a limit on one only so good luck.,positive
"Great fruit! Fast, easy, convenient, stores easy. Makes supper or lunches faster!",positive
"Extremely potent smell and taste - too overwhelming. I got the variety pack, and they're all like that.",negative
Not too sickly sweet. Just enough cherry.,positive
This is the best olive Tapenade I have ever tasted.  First had it at Cat Cora's restaurant.  I am thrilled to be able to order this on line and have it shipped to me.,positive
delicious and reasonably priced!,positive
It can be a challenge to find a furikake that doesn’t taste like the seaweed had been marinated in fish oil. This just has a great flavor and was a wonderful  topping for the rice balls I made for dinner.,positive
Has a great flavor. Will be buying again. Just wish it came in a larger bottle.,positive
"Outstanding,absolutely delicious,my second bar in 2weeks .I need to join a chocolate anonymous meeting !Update : I have purchased 4 times all together -honestly delicious chocolate and FAST shipping.This is my favorite chocolate -try it -you will love it .",positive
"I bought these because they claimed to be made in Korea. I was hoping that meant they may be more guaranteed to be gluten free, or true to the ingredients listed on the package.But they tasted terrible and certainly didn’t taste like it was only sweet potato starch like it claimed to be. What I tasted was not organic. It tasted more like chemicals or additives. I threw it all away.I wouldn’t buy it again, unfortunately.",negative
Title states that the pumpkin will be more than 20lbs.  I received a 10 lb pumpkin.,negative
"Went to use this in a cocktail and it just is overpowering with the citrus acid citrusy flavor. Maybe that's what's expected but if you're looking to use this in any cocktail, I'd look for something else.",negative
Tastes great. The best Izze flavor in my opinion,positive
It’s been over a week since I gotten it freshness,positive
I love the flavor of this so much.... this was my first time trying this flavor and I wished I had bought more at the time . I have not been able to find this item in Amazon or anywhere online since I first tried it.... it seems to be sold out everywhere I have looked . The brand has many flavors but this strawberry& hibiscus is my new favorite .I will keep trying to find this sorbet brand and flavor again .,positive
What's not to like. 3lbs of heavenly candy.,positive
Perfect for making sweet treats on the keto food plan. Reasonable price. Love it! Great taste.,positive
"I personally love this tea and have given small baggies to my friends to try.  It has a smooth taste and I use the chasen to stir it in my coffee mugs. In the mornings, I pour hot water over the tea in my travel mug, shake vigorously and drink it on my commute.  I drink it at night, and even though I am sensitive to caffiene, it will not keep me awake.  The last swig may have a little sediment in it, but you get used to it and feel healthy as you swallow those particles down!  I may try the Do Matcha brand to compare, but so far, I am satisifed.",positive
"I have tasted most of the Seasnax favors and this one keeps me re-ordering because of the spicy kick of chipotle smokey flavor. The roasted leaf is crunchy and light and low cal.  I am seriously addicted to this ""sea"" weed, without any guilt.  The convenient size and packaging is good for travel and also keeps the seaweed from getting crushed.Mmm.",positive
Best taste of pure honey. Thicker than what I was used to. By far the best tasting honey ever!,positive
"Purchased 2 of these as gifts, and the snowman theme on the tins was the reason for selecting these. Tins arrived with a bland dark blue generic exterior with no snowmen. Disappointing. Could not use as gifts.",negative
I really dig these candies. I was pretty bummed out that I only got 4 packs. I was lead to believe I would get 4 of each flavor😭.,positive
"My daughter wanted to enter the hottest chili contest at our church.  I have won for the past several years, and her goal was to make chili hotter than mine.  With this pepper (and TWO others!), she succeeded.  We have a new champion now! If I had to give a one-word description of this pepper, it would be ""FIRE""!  (That is based on the reactions of those who ate it.  My daughter and I aren't idiots!!)",positive
So much flavor but light on calories!,positive
"I love this alternative to conventional cornstarch!  When I found out they produce GMO corn to make bio-fuel, I was thinking... that's not good for us to eat, right??The product works well and food comes out smooth.  I gave some to my hard-to-please mother-in-law and she loves it too.  It passes the test!! Well worth the price.",positive
Very good product and does help digestion.,positive
My kids love these. They taste really good and they are healthy.,positive
"This is either not tallow, or it is tallow that has been corrupted, gone rancid, or otherwise should not be sold.Anyone familiar with tallow knows it’s solid and white at room temperature. This oil is dark yellow, far too fluidic and smells more like burnt lard than tallow.I cannot begin to express my disgust with Amazon since discovering from the other one star reviews that clearly this waste oil is being sold online under their not returnable policy despite being useless and inedible.Get your tallow in person before you get shafted for $30",negative
"This is a smooth and delicious coffee. When I visited Brazil a couple of years ago, I wished I had brought some home. Beantween allowed me to do that retroactively!",positive
Flimsy and very thin. I used it anyways because it was meant to be my main decoration. Thankfully I bought fun candles.,negative
"Usually anything that's relatively inexpensive is going to be the quality you expect, and that's inferior.  NOT THIS COFFEE!  I'm a home roaster with 2 decades of experience and experimentation with beans from all over the world.  I had modest expectations with these Nicaraguan beans, and I was quite surprised.  I roasted to just into second crack (less than French Roast) and I'm very pleased with the cupping that resulted.  I'm gettin' more!!  I even made a cold brew yesterday and started drinking it today.  Very nice.",positive
"Maybe everyone knew but me, but these don't taste like sulfured apricots.  These have little apricot taste and are sweet.  Yuck",negative
"This water has a great fresh taste both room temperature and chilled. Although the price is higher, you do get a significant amount more of water than a normal water bottle. I don't use the screw on lid as a cup (it's purpose) for myself to consume the water, but it is very convenient for my 60 lb Boxer to use as a water bowl when traveling or at the dog park.",positive
this product is awesome shipment was early love them,positive
"This was absolutely delicious-and easy to do. It took a little more time than I thought it would, but it was definitely worth it! I used Idaho brand instant mashed instead of homemade fresh mashed potatoes to save time but I don't think there could be a huge difference. The mashed potatoes come in a bag and in various flavors - I used the plain buttery kind. All it takes is some hamburger and mashed potatoes-the rest is in the bag. Yum!",positive
Every truffle was melted and discolored. I had to throw the entire box away.  The chocolate was discolored and the inside that is supposed to be soft was hard and hollow. Do NOT order this product it is garbage and not returnable !!!!!!!!!!!,negative
Definitely recommend. Great taste. Our 1.5 and 3.5 year old love them!,positive
I loved this licorice all sorts candy..... fresh delivered quickly  - nothing not to like~~~,positive
[[VIDEOID:e87530f81fe3e29aab9ac622dcf5d543]] This is awful it is beef jerky and I would like a refund,positive
"This was amazing brine, turkey come out great and full of flavor",positive
True bang for your buck. I eat a lot of oatmeal and this box was certainly worth the money with how many packets it comes with.,positive
Can't eat this egg free bread since you need egg to make it,negative
Great if you like blow pops. My coworkers devoured them,positive
The taste is superb. I will order this brand in the near future,positive
Perfect! Beautifully packaged and taste great. Thank you! <3,positive
These things are so good. Definitely recommend putting them in the fryer or air fryer to ensure they get crispy.,positive
"Love this pepper mint tea, not too much mint with green tea.",positive
I have bought from this company before - delivery is really fast. This is a fantastic combo of wild smoked salmon and wild Indian Candy. Tried Indian Candy for the first time and loved it. Hard to find this Indian Candy in New York. The packaging is great. Each product comes in 8 oz. packs so I opened one of each and put the other in the freezer for later. The sliced smoked salmon is simply delicious with cream cheese and our famous New York bagels.,positive
Delivered on time and as advertised...good stuff,positive
I’d been trying to find a yummy cherry drop & this is the winner hands down. Great price! I’ll be buying again...thanks,positive
"We have ordered before and it is never cold when it arrives, but usually still cool. This time it was hot and one bottle was smashed and half opened.",negative
"These are THE worst tasting ""olive?"" I've ever had. I say it with a question mark cause it tastes nothing like an olive. I can't place what it tastes like cause I immediately spit it out and threw the rest in the garbage.",negative
"It is too expensive, my friend only spent 1.50 a pack, he got it from Chinese supermarket.",negative
"Great honey, creamy and delicious. that's all I have to say.",positive
I love the flavor and Texture also it was Suuuuper easy to cook!,positive
"Years ago I helped in the honey harvest. The owners, Kirk and Sharon are kind hearted folks who started the business from the ground up with a beautiful superior product. I hope Sharon is still hand crafting candles from the wax. She started Bedazzled candle company. If your in Michigan check out Benzie Country. Amazing sunsets!!!",positive
Tasty and crunchy. Love it,positive
Wrote a first review and said how awesome the company was with sending this plant thru the mail and they would not post my positive review so I tried it again -  It was better than could imagine- very impressed with the delivery of a live plant; it was in perfect condition and beautiful - Thanks for an awesome product.,positive
This came moldy and  now I cant get my money back. Do not buy this!,negative
Will continue to buy and use clear jel.  Great for canned fruit pie fillings.,positive
Great flavor and healthy for healing from breast cancer.,positive
"This was in the description however, I did not realize there was a difference in Keurig capabilities. I had an older model Keurig and when I brewed this kcup the leaves all spilled into the tea cup. Now I have a Keurig Mini and these will not brew at all. Be warned before you buy. They are not cheap…slightly over $1 per cup.",negative
"I followed the directions exactly. In the morning after I stirred it, I noticed that the milk had not been absorbed at all. It was a mushy liquidy mess. I expected this to be the consistency of regular oatmeal, but cold. Boy was I wrong! It was as if I had left a big bowl of milk with cereal in it overnight, the oatmeal pieces were just mush while swimming around a cup of milk. I would never buy this again.",negative
It was good I would buy it again.,positive
This stuff is out of this world on some baby back ribs 👍,positive
This is a good dark coffee and the price is great!,positive
Product was delivered open. Has to go right in the trash.,negative
It was creamy and flavorful.,positive
I drink a ton of coffee and am always buying new kinds to try. This coffee makes a good cup well worth the money. It smells fantastic and as long as you grind it enough makes a nice strong cup of joe. if your a coffee drinker who wants to try something new dont be afraid of this stuff,positive
These are terrible!!! Noodles and soy sauce would taste better than this. The noodles taste like plastic and the sauce tastes like straight up salt without any real flavor. I am not a picky or high maintenance eater but I could not do this noodle bowl.,negative
"Turkish Delight is not a complex dish, it's basically starch, sugar, and some sort of flavor. These come in a nice presentation box containing small sweets in 4 different flavors, rose, strawberry, lemon, and orange. The flavors are great and I really like that the sweets are small, it's not the kind of sweet you need a whole lot of at once. I have just one word of caution, 'Be Careful Where You Open The Box'. The sweets are covered in powdered sugar and no matter how careful you are opening the box, it will go everywhere.",positive
"I bought this and tried it for the first time. I was very disappointed in the finished quality of the popped corn. It was tough and not very tasty at all. I will say that every single kernel popped, but if it doesn't taste good, who cares. I won't waste my money on this again.",negative
"Bought for my father, he loved it.  Great variety of snacks.",positive
Just got it today for my little one. It is expired.,negative
"I bought these for years from my local Costco. Best nachos I've ever had. They stopped carrying them about a year ago, so I tried several different nachos from different stores. They all had this weird.... soury flavor to them yknow? Something was always off. I finally found these again after realizing I never checked Amazon for them. And seriously, am I glad I found these again. They are without a doubt the best nachos I'll ever have. Just make sure to finish it all within 3 weeks or so of opening it.",positive
It is wonderful to have a healthy granola option that is delicious and free of cane sugar and corn syrup. So good. I like to eat it on my yogurt with fruit.,positive
"Title says it all! My favorite flavor of coffee! When I received it today in the mail I opened the envelope that had a very strong coffee smell. Grabbed my other two items from the bottom and realized there was coffee grounds all over the bottom and items. I can deal with a smushed box, but opened kcups and busted up kcups aren’t the best. Still love this coffee!",positive
"I don't know what to say really because I'm blown away by this cocoa. It's absolutely sublime. In the past I would spend money on raw cacao from reputable sources but went ahead and tried this on the recommendation of Nina Planck in her latest book about Real Food. Again, blown away. The smell is of pure brownies. The color is so rich and comparing it to my fancy raw cacao was funny because the Pernigotti Cocoa was so much richer.Buy this. You won't be sorry. Add it to desserts, coffee, hot chocolate, chia pudding, chocolate pudding, whatever. It's damn delicious.",positive
"Amazing. I use to get the American version of these as a child with my dad, we absolutely loved these and then they just disappeared one day. So glad I found these they taste exactly like I remember. Will definitely be ordering again.",positive
"In the past, have made popcorn at home and the popcorn would come out like you were biting down on packing peanuts.  Did some research and found out that fresh kernels is all about how much moisture is inside and the amount of moisture and how quickly you get the kernel to pop is what results in the movie theater type popcorn everyone loves.  These kernels do pop smaller popcorn as described but they are tender, soft, and the husks are almost non-existent.  More expensive than getting Orville's in the store but to me, it's worth it.  I've made homemade caramel corn with these and it came out great.",positive
I don’t know what the other reviews are talking about this flavor is amazing,positive
"A good brand, will purchase again, lovely flavor with chips or veggies on top of a tater. Glad I tried this one, there are several flavors, so far all good taste and fresh, good package, tight lid so stays fresh, mix it up with middle ingredients for more flavor over all but I like to just leave it in the center sometimes, nice brand glad I tried it",positive
This is our favorite rice! It seems to be the first rice that I can cook perfectly.,positive
This great as an iced tea. It tastes exactly the same as it smells out of the package.,positive
Awesome.  Kids love them.  So do I :),positive
A favorite when we lived in the UK  I wished that that they would be more readily available in the USAThanks Amazon,positive
"I have a condition that causes excessive dry mouth.  I needed sugarless, and while not as strong as Brach’s butterscotch, they have just enough flavor and do the job.  Smooth and yummy candies.",positive
"I have been baking pretty consistently for five years so I feel qualified to leave a review on this yeast. I have always just bought whatever I could get at the grocery store until the last few months. I wasn't able to find yeast anywhere. I decided to get this yeast on Amazon. It showed up quickly and perfectly sealed. I have made rolls, multiple loaves of bread, cinnamon rolls and multiple focaccia pizza doughs with it. This yeast is the most active I have ever used. I typically like to retard the leavening of my pizza dough in the refrigerator overnight (allows enzymes to work and add flavor depth). Usually it raises a bit in the fridge but not a lot. When I use this yeast and the same recipe that I've always used, the dough is going over the top while being refrigerated. I love this stuff!",positive
"Love the peach taste, will order again!",positive
Bought this for my husband for Christmas he loves fudge and he said it was pretty good so I will definitely be buying this product again.,positive
[[VIDEOID:5a315aa7ced0d0edd5eb805b47f0c3fc]] This is horrible they mixed ol meat with new meat the meat looked wrong and i want to talk to the store manager,negative
This cake topper was the absolute perfect addition to the cake for my son‘s proposal. It was absolutely beautiful! The sparkles just gave it that perfect extra touch,positive
Keeps user hydrated,positive
Little pricey the best concentrate by the found. I drink my tea unsweetened and my husband drinks it with sweetener we love it,positive
"I have enjoyed drinking this coffee on the last cold days of winter and it really hits the spot. I  usually drink Califia cold brew coffee but this is great too. I am trying to stay low carb and I was looking for an alternative to hot cocoa and this really helps alleviate that craving. I'd like to try the vanilla flavor next.  I also appreciate the gluten free labelling as with flavored coffees a lot of times they're not safe for celiac, so without that labelling I wouldn't be able to drink this.",positive
"These are the BEST.  I don't like other Skinnygirl products so I was tempted NOT to try, but they are amazing.  No sugars.....and still amazingly good.",positive
Quick delivery and tasty to boot,positive
"I bought boxes of these for my husband for Father's Day.  We both have to eat gluten free.  These are absolutely delicious, and you'd never know they are gluten free.  They are quite expensive so we'd only order them for gifts for each other, but know they'd be much appreciated.",positive
Delicious taffy that tastes exactly like the flavor name!,positive
Made me sick  stay away,negative
Delicious and tangy. Great handy snack.,positive
I received it cracked and it is was unable to be returned.,negative
"Why bother with a Vegan Gluten free item when there is added white sugar?  up to 6 grams in some!!! and when you finally are able to read the ingredient list, you find out it's not returnable.  Dont' be fooled.",negative
Beautiful taste in bite-sized packages,positive
"I have been drinking Roma beverage drink for about 20 years and I love it. It is an acquired taste if you have been drinking coffee for years, but when my doctor told me no more caffeine, this was my new coffee. Even Decaffeinated coffee has a minute amount of caffeine that bothered me.  I add fat free half and half and enjoy it as much as I did coffee. There is a naturally occurring slight sweetness to the product which I really like, so I don' t add any sugar. This product does not contain any sugar or other sweeter.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who must eliminate caffeine from their diet and wants a warm beverage to replace that ""holding a cup of coffee habit.""",positive
"I'm so happy I found this! I love the Earl Grey Tea at Starbucks and this is the same. Bold, flavorful, a hint of lavender. I think the price is great too.",positive
These came quickly and in great shape. The growth on top was longer than the 4 inch stalks in some instances.I'd recommend,positive
I use this in most of my baking recipes. Love it!,positive
"this is very good i""ve usedsome & shared some",positive
Love the taste and always fresh. Good value too.,positive
Have used Bearcreek kithen products for years and the quality has never been less than excellent.,positive
"This item is NOT what  was shipped !They substituted BRACH'SBobs candy cane has been a family holiday tradition for 35 years.So when I could not find them at my local level , I ordered them online at a  PREMIUM PRICE !Very disappointed but not as much as my 87 yr old  mother it was her family Christmas gift to the great grandchildrenwaiting to see if i will get a refuned",negative
They were fine for the mustard I made.  Feel weird giving mustard seeds a rating as they're just seeds but they made good mustard.,positive
I bought this for my grandmother who is an avid tea drinker and she loves it. So far she has only tried a few but has already claimed that she is going to pick out her favorites and order more!,positive
Love love love.  Reminded me of home!,positive
I expected these chocolates would be fresh. They were powdery white. Every one of them. This indicates they were old. Very disappointed and would never recommend from the vendor.,negative
Not good. The chocolate is poor quality and the peanut butter tastes like dry powder. Would not buy again.,negative
Delish - fast delivery - thanks!,positive
"Not only did these seeds have very low yield when they do but they did not produce what they promised to deliver. Specifically, out of the entire package of camomile, only 1-2 plants survived. The rest of the packages either produced nothing or cheap grass (consistently one species of grass) that I had to clean up later. Very very disappointed.",negative
Favorite spice to add to burgers! I can not find this in store and have not been able to find it online for such a great price! Makes my burgers taste amazing!,positive
Favorite from younger years. Not available locally.,positive
"I received ""Wasabi Mate Assorted Rice Cracker"" as a Christmas gift from my sister.  They are unusually good, very fresh, with a light crunch and heat that didn't overpower my palate (I'll leave that to HOT Mate, a package of which arrived with the Wasabi Mate).  Excellent cracker assortment with many different flavors and textures. The crackers come in a large cellophane bag that contains eight individual two-ounce packets.  This method keeps the crackers fresh, but all that plastic leaves behind a pretty large footprint, environmentally speaking.  I'd love to see more Asian products packaged in rice paper.  Just food for thought.UPDATE, 4/22/13: The Hot Mate rice crackers are just as good as the Wasabi Mate.  In fact, in some ways, they are even better!  But both kinds are so yummy I'll enjoy either one.",positive
"I became addicted to this slightly sour in a  sweet way flavor and could no longer find it. It was around  in stores for a movie promo at a local big chain and as much as I love juicy fruit ( I am a confessing I am a gum addict) this flavor is awesome!!! A bit tangy and sort of like a green apple with just the right combo of sweet and sour but not too sour. No pucker face here.  I love that I can order so many in this pack and it comes to less  $ than original in store. Each pack has 15 pieces . I keep them in my car, bag , home . Tastiest and favorite gum.  If you like green apples and gum - this is an awesome combo!",positive
My cat loves it and it seems to help with fleas. I give them to him as a treat.,positive
Exceptional honey with a highly distinctive sensory profile. Highly recommended.,positive
I absolutely love these noodles!  They are so nice and almost creamy with a delicious taste of butter and cheese is the best that I can describe them.  I never get tired of eating these.  I wish they cost less and there was more in the cups.  I also love the shrimp flavor but these are even better.  The noodles are wider and thicker than the shrimp-flavored noodles.  That is a real nice touch!,positive
"I’m American, and it’s hard to find instant ramen here that also tastes decent. Most of the brands I’ve tried are bland or not good at all, which sucks because I like spicy flavorful ramen.This is my favorite brand. It’s hard to find in stores, but I love the spices in it. It actually has flavor and tastes really good. Got me through year 1 of college/university.I like that the spices come in a separate packet. My roommate did not like spices, so when they made ramen, they used 0 spices and I got a double portion of spices (my portion + their portion) because I like my ramen spicy.I recommend cooking it on the stovetop because it tastes better than microwaving. Also, adding Bulgogi to it makes it taste even better.Only downside is it’s a little expensive I think, but I’m also a broke college student lol. Anyway it’s great and student-approved by me :)",positive
The best flava ever. My family uses this on EVERYTHING,positive
good color fair price.,positive
We found these after  Trader Joe's stopped selling them.  Finally these are the best ever!,positive
I like good coffee and this made a good cup! Will buy again.,positive
"This is a great deal. They look awesome and they take even better.  There is no better value around. Compared to the national brand, there's no comparison. These raisins are twice the size and at  least one half of the cost. Lots of creamy milk chocolate covering plump fresh raisins. Comes in a giant 2lb resealable bag. Can't ask for more.",positive
We purchased these because Easy-Mac wasn’t available. Nobody in my house liked the flavor. The noodles literally taste like cardboard. We will pass next time.,negative
I eat almost daily. Makes me feel full and satiated. Fresh and good quality. Highly recommended,positive
"Love this mix.....the taste, texture, and versatility! The only one I use.",positive
"Tastes awesome! Now if I could only find a source for FRESH cheese curds, It would be awesome. If you have never had Poutine, You are missing out! This stuff is the next best thing to a trip to Canada for Poutine lovers in the US. But if you CAN make it to Canada, I highly recommend trying this amazing Canadian dish.",positive
These are not Tellicherry peppercorns.  They were sold and labeled as such but all false claims.  Random size peppercorns some small some medium sized.  Tellicherry should all be large at least 4.25mm.  Will not purchasing from seller again.,negative

"Perfect package,  great flavor",positive
"My FAVORITE peanut butter ever! (and I love peanut butter) It is hard to find this particular flavor at my local grocery store, although I have seen it at Target. Jif whips has less fat than regular peanut butter, which is also a plus. If you are a salted caramel fan, this is a must try.",positive

Sadaf teas are delicious! I love this one and it is my go-to tea. The shipping was quick and arrived nicely packaged.,positive
"These Orgain shakes are very good.  There are added vitamins and a nice balance between fats, carbohydrates, and protein.  They even have iodine in them!  Keep in mind this formula has some sugar in it.  For those looking for a low sugar/sugar free version the Orgain ready to drink protein (blue label) is available but it doesn’t have the added vitamins.  I alternate between the two.",positive
Used for cooking and flavoring drinks! Much cheaper than coffee syrups.,positive
"Delicious!!!  Great way to get protein and fiber!  I am not a real breakfast person, but just love everything about these.  Fast and easy to make!",positive
Husband loves this spice,positive
"Barney butter is life!! Always creamy doesn't separate or get rancid.. the crunchy roasted bits take the cake!  Its my reward after a workout  with a tsp of coconut oil.  Life is tough, workouts are tough, Barney butter makes me hsppy",positive
"So happy to find this in a ""fine"" grind. It is absolutely perfect!",positive
"This item made my granddaughters cake be exactly what she wanted. I personally don't like fondant icing, so chose not to taste them, but they blended so well with the icing I don't know if I would have even known if I ate any of it. The application was even easier than the instructions stated. Each doll and LOL did have to be cut out individually, but it wasn't a problem and didn't have to be too precise as putting into the icing made it very forgiving. I was pleased, but most importantly, my granddaughter could not have been happier.",positive
"PERFECT for baking. I can never use fresh milk fast enough, and this is shelf stable, and I can always add a few tablespoons to sauces of dough to add some richness to it, with great results. Will buy again and again!",positive
"I’ve never made beignets before but was willing to give it a go. Super easy to follow instructions. I’ve worked with bread dough and pizza dough before so I am at least familiar with dough properties. This is pretty easy to roll out and form. They fried up nicely and tasted good covered in powdered sugar. Then I thought, I wonder how a thinner batter would fry up as a pancake. I made a thin pourable batter and put into fry pan with some oil and a bit of butter. They cooked up crispy around the edges and kind of a butter custard flavor on inside. I like thin and crispy pancakes and this batter worked out great. There aren’t pancake instructions on the package but just add more water to make a thin batter. This is a great use of this mix when you don’t feel like deep frying. I dustwith powdered sugar, maple syrup, and fruit compote as toppings. Delicious. Make sure you use enough oil so that they get crispy. The fact all this mix needs is water is great and makes it easy to quickly whip up some tasty treats. I recommend this tasty product.",positive
Wonderful consice packaging. I also appreciate the information that came with it. I am currently making my first batch of water kefir. Thank you for the beautiful grains.,positive
Delish!  ;o),positive
"Very pleasantly surprised. They just arrived moist, sweet and not dried up like was mentioned in the reviews I read for other cheaper brands. Worth the extra couple of dollars.",positive
Love this stuff! Between using this daily and essential oils my immune system has been more supported through this winter and I haven't been sick at all!,positive
I struggle with low blood pressure so I have to drink a lot more water than most. I love body armor because they taste good and have vitamins and minerals that help me keep my BP up. Love this flavor.,positive
Best coffee ever! First tasted while vacationing on Kauai,positive
"I usually always make my own cranberry sauce, however this sauce was absolutely delicious",positive
"This is a different tasting water. It's different in a sense that it tastes very pure. Once you drink this then you drink other well known spring water, the spring water tastes dirty. I highly recommend.",positive
"Photo is misleading. I was mislead and only looked at the photo although it is labeled incorrectly as “beef cube steak”. So, I received the wrong product for a dinner party. I should have read the description but I only looked at the image.",negative
"Like: Nice rich color, fresh, great smoky flavor especially in roasted meats or Spanish rice!No dis-likes!",positive
"I use this mainly for making popcorn and it works great. I love the flavor it imparts into the popcorn. It really is the only thing I have used it in so far.With that said, I do have kind of an issue with the company.  I really dont like buying products on amazon and having the companies email me asking for a review. If I feel your product is worthy of a review both in good and/or bad, I will post it in my own time. Amazon already sends out notices to review the products we purchase, I don't need more email on the same thing.Now this last part is both great and bad at the same time. Along with asking for a review, you also state with each review you will make a donation to a specific charity. I think that is awesome that they are willing to do that but at the same time it also makes me feel like I am being bribed for my review. Maybe if you had that donation offer in your product listing instead of the email asking for a review it would feel less like a bribe to me. And it may just be me feeling this way, I am after all, becoming old and set in my ways lol.",positive
The BEST Butter EVER !,positive
we try to cut back on sugar when we can. these make it easy.,positive
The first thing I made with my paste was a vanilla ice cream. All I can say is none of it went into the reezer.,positive
There was black mold inside multiple boxes of Couscous,negative
"This stuff is great!  If you have ever been on a reduced carb diet, you know that the alternatives to flour are basically gross.  Almond meal does not rise and coconut flour tastes like coconut so if you are making something savory it's pretty nasty.  This makes delicious biscuits, and pancakes.  I have not tried all of the recipes yet, but I will.  This is the best carb alternative you will find.  A definite must get!!!",positive
Buyer beware!!! This is not a full box of snacks as pictured.  We received 46 pieces but half of it was super tiny individual pieces of candy! Like twislers and tootsie roll suckers. This was a total rip off in my opinion!!,negative
"The tea was so good it is memorable.  I didn’t like paying the price they want, but DANG is it good.",positive
"Easier to chew than many others.  Good flavor too, not hot.",positive
"Definitely it does refreshes the whole digestive system, it does help to keep inflammation down, and its very tasty actually, I use it in salads, rice, vegetables ... bread ...  its health benefits are too many to avoid having it. I use it with oregano oil / carvacrol at least once a day.",positive
My mother in low love this.,positive
I am completely satisfied with this purchase 👍,positive
"BBC's 3 hour adaptation of the novel by Sarah Waters...""Fingersmith"". Life is tough without money, especially in Dickensian London. Dark deeds lead to despicable dilemmas.Is love really just a luxury for the rich and free ?? Elaine Cassidy as ""Maud Lilly"" and Sally Hawkins as ""Sue Trinder"" both give fantastic performances as the leading ladies asking this question ... OF EACH OTHER ...whilst Rupert Evans shines as the delightfully bad ""Gentleman"".. with great support from Imelda Staunton's ""Mrs Sucksby"", David Troughton's ""Mr Ibbs"" and Charles Dance's ""Uncle"". The plot twists and turns and I wasn't sure I could be led to care about characters able to hurt and use each other in this way... but somehow.. i do care... and thats because of the quality of the performances... love feels like love .. hate feels like hate... betrayal .. confusion.. well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you will get the DVD and enjoy.( Elaine Cassidy is just great in this.. gorgeous in fact.... i have to declare i am in her fan club... Hi Elaine : )",positive
"If you found these in the garbage unopened for free, just leave them there. There are five boxes with 20 capsules of each variety. Three varieties had NO flavor. Well kind of the flavor of old water you find in a sports bottle you took to the gym last week and forgot about in the back of your car. One pack contained almost no actually sealed pods. There were coffee grounds freaking everywhere! And then the final pack contained sealed pods that brewed something almost coffee like. Sort of tasted like in college when you can't find a filter and brew drip coffee through your roommate's tube sock you found on the floor under an old pizza box and the empty bottle of Snapple that LaCrosse player filled with his chew backwash the other night.",negative
"From what I have researched, this is an excellent cooking oil and offers many health benefits including heart health.  I believe it is intended more for medium heat cooking.",positive
A healthy alternative to sugary granola bars and they taste great!,positive
Love this Olive Oil.The taste is excellent and cooks nicely,positive
every single individual pack in the box was smashed to A FINE POWDER upon arrival and all of the shipping boxes were perfectly fine. I would return this if i didn't throw out the box already assuming they were all good.,negative
I love these trees! It was a great price and I received more cuttings than expected. It’s a very good deal. They were easy to grow and are thriving. I am about to move them to bonsai soil and pots. I started out super nervous but the willow is a great tree to start with! I will definitely buy again.,positive
We all loved these. Decadent chocolate and yummy marshmallow.,positive
Very disappointed.  I ordered these because our small town didn’t have them but it was a total waste of money!  More than half were broken! There was no padding etc. to keep them from breaking!,negative

"There is only a handful of candies in this bag that are ""vintage"" not enough candy period and missing the items we wanted for our decades party. Total disappointment. We took the time to count and barely had 3 dozen pieces of candy. $24 total rip-off. Do not order. You are better off going to cracker barrel.",negative
Inedible and not eligible for returns. Tastes like cough medicine but actually 748932x worse. Tried to give it to my friends but she tried it and said absolutely not. Waste of $15,negative

Very good!!! Will order this next time I run out,positive

I have purchased and used this coffee for over three years.  I find that it smells delightful while brewing and the taste. Does not disappoint.  I add a bit of creamer to my coffee and enjoy it warm or iced.  It has become my drink of choice!,positive

High quality good flavor,positive
"not spicy, a little sweet.",negative
"I have been using this product since Winter and drink it everyday in a green drink (pineapple juice, coconut water, filtered water, maca powder and wheatgrass powder) which I put in my blender or shake up in a glass bottle. I have found it makes me feel clearer headed and have much more stamina for working out.I strongly recommend this product.",positive
"I can pretty much choke down anything from not so tasty protein bars to nutrition drinks in the name of health and even though I know this creamer isn’t natural, I was looking for an alternative to my calorie-ridden creamers.  So I thought I’d give this a try and just like everyone else says here, it’s truly awful.  It doesn’t even taste like food, it tastes like chemicals.  It’s NOT sweet but in fact bitter!!  Walden Farms needs to keep working on this one as their other products are pretty decent!",negative
"I have been taking maca for years in the capsule form. Decided to give this a try, no regrets!  Will buy again. I put a half teaspoon in about a 1/4 cup of water and let sit for about 10 minutes. The powder stirs up nice after sitting in water for a bit. Tastes fine.  Give it a try and save some money!",positive
"I love this matcha insta fuel! It is so delicious it's a perfect jump start to my day. I just ran out and I'm totally repurchasing this product. Right now I'm loving using half hot water and half plant milk, mainly oat milk unsweetened and it is a perfect combo. It's super blendable into the milk and you have the option to just blend it with water because there's already coconut milk as the creamer in the matcha.",positive
"Lately, I have been buying these michelin chef, hand made, listen to classical music, expensive tellicherry bla bla peppercorns. I, like others, love really fresh aromatic black pepper. Yum. I still do buy it, but I want to use it more selectively. My wallet was getting a little worried about me.This is good, has nice aroma, flavor and heat. Not like the saw dusty, stale smelling ones at the store with no reason for existing... :-o.  And with this big quantity and good quality, I am back to gun slinging black pepper everywhere. Watch out little doggy!",positive
My kiddo loved these!  The flavors are great and they are super cool to watch “explode” in your warm milk or water!!,positive
This is the best gravy mix I have found,positive
Great treats for the welcome table.,positive
It was great for my chocolate covered pretzel rods...,positive
"Great MILD Curry Powder, mine was a year old and the seal was broken - but it was shrink wrapped. Still surprisingly fragrant, I have made 5 vegan curries with it so far, love the flavor. 2 Tablespoons of this with some garam masala, mango or amchur powder, and some chili paste will really make a nice curry, especially if you make garlic ginger paste fresh. Can't go wrong with Rani. Even with just this curry powder and coconut milk (or yogurt) + roasted veggies you would have a crowd pleaser. This powder saves a lot of time in your cooking. Another tip my friend taught me with oil-free vegan curry is to really put a good char on some ~10% of your veggies by oven roasting them a little extra or flashing them in your pan on high when everything is mixed together, adds a lot of flavor and aroma.",positive
Use this instead of lotion on face and body - keeps the skin moist always! Even works on dry hair. Love it!,positive
I ordered the Maud's Raspberry Chocolate Coffee for cold weather enjoyment. Delicious.,positive
My picky authentic-Thai seeking husband liked it.,positive
"I like dates, and dark chocolate so I figured these would be great.  I am actually enjoying them more than I thought I would.  There is definitely a nice orange flavor to the dark chocolate, which is complemented nicely by the date center.  These definitely contain a lot of sugar, but oddly they don't seem overly sweet.  In fact, usually I can power through a small bag of chocolate like this in a few minutes, but instead I find myself  eating these slowly (and so really does make snack).  They have some other flavors of these snacks and so I will have to check them out as well.",positive
I love the coffee seriously one of the best I have tried it took me a couple months to get something that I would keep going back for this did it for me. I love the fact that you can choose what comes in your box the flavors are absolutely amazing I'm not a big flavored coffee person but the difference in roast and these coffee is amazing every single one taste so good. I definitely recommend this coffee to anyone!,positive
"They break getting them out of the package, too pricey for what you get",negative
Amazing flavor and taste but expensive then other brands. Sometimes worth it.,positive
"Love a good Butterfingers, these were great!",positive
"These noodles are good. If you've been gluten free and egg free for a while, you know that a  good noodle is hard to find. I like these because they are a decent texture and flavor when I want a noodle to replace the egg noodles I grew up with. They are comforting to eat.The texture is a bit different than your standard egg noodle -- don't expect potato starch to behave exactly like wheat in this noodle. Follow the cooking instructions and don't under or overcook and use with a sauce that you would typically use with egg noodles or other similar noodles. I find these to be a great comfort at a time I am allergic to almost everything.",positive
I was ordering grade A and the package clearly states grade B. These are the smallest vanilla beans I have ever purchased and I cannot return them and expensive.,negative
I have used it before. That's all I use for my maple cookies,positive
This was simple yet perfect. I just got a plain cake and added these paper sloth decorations and it gave it the right touch. Super cute and sturdy.,positive
"This is one of my fiance's favorites but can be kind of hard to find in stores. It has a great flavor and is very easy to make. We love to pair it with shrimp, seafood, or chicken.",positive
So is used this for the 1st time on some wings.  As i'm eating the wings i'm wondering why they are so salty when all i have added is this lemon pepper.  I go back and look at the package and see that salt is the main ingredient.  I was shopping for lemon and pepper as a salt alternative not salt.  All that being said the flavor is good if you don't mind the salt.,negative
"I was so excited to get this organic Chai tea, but boy, was I disappointed!  This Chai tea has no taste at all. I put in multiple bags just to get the Chai taste. Nothing. It’s like drinking hot water. What a waste of money!",negative
Lemon water in general is healthy and with this water I don’t have to worry about adding lemon juice to the water it has just flavor,positive
Offer of the one favor I want,positive
I like how it works great with green tea to curb my appetite.,positive
This is a very good product to have in your pantry. It is a much softer noodle to work with. Not too heavy for even a late night soup.  My mom really love the product and it has made a difference to her.  We use a chicken or beef bullion cube while the water is boiling to season the noodle and serve it and add vegetables or just have the noodles alone.,positive

"Hello,  The Peppermint Bark was very good, however the peppermint was very scarce, and that was not a good thing. The peppermint candy cane  is precisely why I ordered this candy,  on the box it showed the bark being loaded with peppermint, but in actuality it did not appear the way is was on the box. Some people may may prefer this small amount and not be alarmed by this, and some may not, to each its own. Overall the Bark was good could be better with more peppermint. Thanks",positive
Great deal for only $.75. They were fresh and soft.,positive
"This is the best tasting Ginger Tea I have bought.  I find myself adding a tea bag of it to myother teas, i.e. oolong, pomegranate, green, and hibiscus.  Illinois Lyle",positive
They are low in saturated fat and taste great.,positive
"I love minty gum, and this is definitely one of the more unique ones out there. Sweet but with a very nice herbal note that I can't quite pinpoint. Was honestly expecting another play on the whole ""winter mint"" style but was pleasantly surprised. Probably my favorite from Ice Breakers.",positive
I love their other products.  Not much flavor.,negative
These are great-tasting and really made the coffee cake I used it in almost impossible to stop eating!,positive
I bought this seasoning on a whim... Fantastic product!  It tastes great and is well-priced.  You can use it to make a healthier garlic bread than what you'd buy in the store.,positive
"I purchased this product for the first time.  And last.  Truthfully, I never written a negative review, but with this coffee, I have to give my honest opinion.  I can't get by the taste.  It takes horrible. I brewed it according to the directions (2 tablespoons per 8 oz. cup) and it tastes like hot, dirty bath water. I was hoping for the best, relying on how other's rated it.  So disappointed!  I will be reordering the Cacao Bliss Brain Enhancing Nootropic Coffee today.  It's a tad more expensive, but I like it a lot!  Note to self: don't buy something to save a few dollars to replace something you already like.",negative
Nice not to run out like small cans from store.  Great taste.,positive
This is my favorite microwave popcorn. It’s super light and crispy with just the perfect amount of salt. I end up eating it at least every other day.,positive
The jar is a nice touch for storing the cinnamon. Will be buying from this company again.,positive
"I grew up in Japan and while japanese curry is all over there, you won’t find it in japanese restaurants here. This is the exact same taste from my childhood, and the whole family loves it. Mild with a hint of sweetness. Total perfection. These are big boxes so you only need 1 box to feed a large family curry.",positive
When I unboxed my package and found flour had spilled inside. I inspected the bag of flour and found a tear near the top opening. Not sure if it was damaged during transit and if the quality of the product was compromised.,negative

"I was distraught when Bronco Bob's disappeared from the only store that carried it near me. It was a few years before I tried googling it again and came across B. Bob's. I thought at first it was a wannabe product trying to ride off a similar name, but I finally put out the cash and tried it and was thrilled to find out it was the exact same product. I don't understand the name and packaging change, but I'm glad I have it back in my pantry.",positive
Really want to like this but way too salty. If I could get rid of the salt they are great caramel and chocolate.,negative
Great product my kids love it!,positive

I have tried several different vintages of Albertina wines and I have been impressed with each and every bottle. I am not what one would call a fan of wine but this wine made me want to love it!! I joined their wine club after trying the wine for the first time and am VERY sad that I now live in a state where I cannot continue to receive the shipments. I've given this wine as a gift with rave reviews. I've taken it to parties with rave reviews. DEFINITELY worth the money.,positive
I probably order these once a month.,positive
"This is my go to flavor for smoked bbq pork shoulders. I add salt, pepper, garlic first then use this over top to add a crust. I’ll inject at this time if I need to. I smoke at 265° until internal is 165°. Then I wrap in butcher paper and continue to smoke until 203° internal temp. I let it rest for 5 minutes per pound in a yeti cooler. With gloves and gloves inserts I shred the bbq into delicious pork strands. This seasoning is amazing. Not too spicy, but zesty enough your socks fly right off.",positive
"If you already like the Pepperidge Farm brand of these wafers, you should like these too ~ same delicate, flaky crispness w/ a yummy creme inside ~ the only difference I can discern is that this is a slightly smaller can, so YMMV in regards to being satisfied w/ the price as well.",positive
"Love the flavor and texture of these in tomato lentil soup. I do wish they were more affordable, but I will definitively purchase them again - budget permitting.",positive
"My family just loves cashews. We've tried just about every brand out there, including Planters, of course. They're mostly all pretty good, but these are exceedingly great. We discovered our Absolute favorite brand - Emerald Jumbo Cashews (which we found & get on soap.com, a subsidiary of Amazon.com).Kirkland usually proves to be a reliably good brand, usually with good prices, too. So, when I recently found these on Amazon, I decided to give these a try... And boy, we were not disappointed; they are a new big hit here! They are large, good texture, & great taste. What more can I say? My family & I very highly recommend these.",positive
"I let these soak for a while and felt they never lost their firmness, which made it hard to chew. Some of the pieces were extremely large which made it difficult to eat",negative
"This electrolyte powder changed my entire view of electrolytes. I cannot stand the artificial flavor of all other “natural” products such as Ultimate and Nuun. Goodonya is flavorful but not sicky sweet-my body now craves it. As a Crohns patient, I’ve lost part of my colon and gained a colostomy. Hydration is essential and Goodonya meets the criteria. The product quality is well worth the price!",positive
My daughter started me on this when I was visiting in San Antonio.  She sent me home with a couple of jars. I think I have bought 8 jars since that visit. I have to use the medium and it is perfect spicy. I had one jar come in with a small lid leak but they wrap them very well. Amazon's stock is always small so make sure you don't let the order get transferred to someone with high shipping charges.Bill,positive

"I’m not super picky about coffee but probably more selective than most people. For reference, of national brands, Peet’s is basically the only one I like. This is right up there with Peet’s decaf on taste and half the price (per ounce) so a really great value for the taste.",positive
"Pretty awesome stuff, the milk taste is great, plus  it melts in the mouth like butter 😋",positive
"Let me start off my saying that I’ve been drinking energy drinks since I was a youngster (new early  teens) been living off them and coffee shots ever since. Red Bull was my go to and honestly still is when I really need to get going out n about but for everyday day use I decided to give Celsius a try. Sparkling Cucumber lime got me hooked and now I decided to branch out with different flavors. The sparkling watermelon is absolutely delicious!!! This particular line Definitely does get the heart pumping if you need a good boost to get things done around the house. I drink chilled. Even when warmed to room temp it still tastes pretty good and what’s even better if you don’t finish the can throw it back in the fridge, drink the next day. No joke taste the same as when you originally opened it. I prefer the sparkling Stevia line but I’m sure the other flat drinks are just as good. For my self I need a lil bubbly. What’s advertised are real results. Does curb cravings and appetite in general, the blood pumping, sweating from constant moving to burn calories (boosting your metabolism) burning fat, focusing, multitasking by being more alert but a calming natural decrease in energy towards the end of the day. Some reviewers are using as a pre-workout... I suppose you can, it’s up to the individual. I have a high tolerance for caffeine so I actually use a potent pre-work and add BCAs designed for weight lifting and long distance running. All’s I can say is to try the product bc either way you won’t be disappointed and adjust accordingly to what fits you n your lifestyle.The next flavor I want to try is the sparkling pear or wild berry.",positive

"This is not Kombucha tea. Kombucha is not a plant - there are no Kombucha leaves to make a Kombucha tea bag from. Kombucha is a living fermented beverage, made from regular black or green tea, sugar, and a SCOBY (Symbiotic Colony Of Bacteria and Yeasts). This is very much like selling a ""beer tea bag"". If the public didn't understand what beer is, and only knew it was good for you, then perhaps Yogi Teas would market a ""beer tea bag"" as well as this phony ""Kombucha tea"". At least the label says ""Inspired by"".",negative

"What happened? Campbell's bean with bacon soup used to be a favorite of mine and my wife. We haven't had it for a long time and were anxious to try it again. Both of us were disappointed. The flavor has changed. Is it the addition of monosodium glutamate, ""smoke flavoring"", or something else? Also, it seemed much saltier. I would like to see its ingredient list from past years.",negative

I thought I was getting K cups and was initially disappointed until I just made a cup with the hot water from the machine with the powder placed in the bottom of a mug. I overcame my disappointment with the wonderful flavor! I have enjoyed this purchase with the unusually cold weather recently!,positive
"Had this gum back in Asia but sadly can’t find it in the US market except in here. This gun give an amazing strong mint that last a good 3-5 min then tone down as you time pass. However, the gym remain in good chew condition.",positive
Quality grains and they grew very quickly. Will buy again when I buy more grains.,positive
Couldn't stop eatting these.,positive
Tasty nuts. Fresh. Larger in size then the almonds this bag replaced. Will buy again.,positive
This is the 3rd bag I've ordered. I love the Birthday Cake!,positive
Anyone have some advice??? I need it!!,neutral
"This coffee is fantastic, will continue to order in the future, great taste and price!!",positive
I ordered the 60 pod variety pack. I only received 20 pods of two flavors…,negative
I love these better than “regular” name brand ones. Super addicting. Great snack for all ages,positive
These were awesome! Flavorful taste and cute shapes.,positive
I loved the black cherry flavored water I loved it on the first taste,positive
The package is perfect and product is very good. Delivered on time. I recommend,positive
Best tasting decaf tea.  Been drinking since my trip to Ireland 16 years ago. Great price,positive
I drink honey water everyday.,positive
So FRESH that most of the roots sprouted.  I use them in my smoothies.  If you go to this site you will see the enormous benefits of including turmeric in your diet:,positive
"Definitely a favorite. I like the limited, clean ingredients. Tastes great too!",positive
I won't buy it again.  I prefer the nexpresso brand,negative
"I just started a Keto/Paleo eating plan and this has been a saving grace. I've only tried the chocolate, but it's awesome. I can't wait to try the others. Combined with Two Good yogurt it's even better.",positive
"Yet another great offering from the great folks at Coffee People. This has quickly risen to the top of the list as one of my favorite K-cups. Strong, rich flavor without being bitter, slightly sweet and caramel/nutty flavour makes this just a perfect cup of coffee for me. Highly recommend trying, tastes convincingly similar to some coffee from Kauai a friend brought back from Hawaii for me.",positive
"This particular brand of tea is hard to find so we decided to order it on line.  Great tast and very refreshing, especially ice.",positive
These are the best tasting fruit bars!,positive
i love these but price went up so will not order again,positive
"This is the best gluten free flour blend for baking cookies and cakes than anything else on the market. I've tried them all - Cup for Cup, Better Batter, Jules (which is awful), Bob's Red Mill (horrible), Kruteaz, and the list goes on. If I can't find this, I make my own blend using the same ingredients listed on this box. But it's much cheaper to buy through walmart. I don't use this to make breads or pie crusts but it works for pretty much every other application.",positive
Love it n my tea. Also great for superficial burns and bug bites,positive
"This was my first time trying this product. I typically go with another well known brand. These were exceptionally good, with a bold flavor and great crunch.",positive
Very salty. And I like salt. Even too salty for me.,negative
I loved these wrappers. They made the tables look so polished with that personal touch. The seller was great too. They did a rush job for me.,positive
Oh my gosh was expecting that comforting bacon taste and it was awful!  Total waste of money.,negative
I love the smell of rose and this rose water smells exactly like if you have a bouquet of roses in water for a few days. I can’t wait to use it in so many things!,positive
"These Tosi snacks are extremely tasty.  The only issue I have with these is the fact that they can be a bit of a crumbly mess.  I've found I like every flavor of these I've tried.  So far I've had Coconut, Cashew, Peanut Dark Chocolate, and Cashew Coconut.  They're all delicious in their own way.  Even better is the fact that these are variety packs.  I'm not stuck with just a single flavor.  These are super crunchy but ridiculously easy to bite into.  Just make sure you're not spilling crumbs all over.  I highly recommend you avoid eating these in vehicles or your office desk.  The 1oz size is like a single bar and just enough when you need a small bite to hold you over.  Super hungry, but the wife is bringing down supper in 30 minutes?  Snag the 1oz bar.  Super hungry, but you're out on the trail and it might be a few hours before you eat?  Snag the 2.4-ounce bar.  It's got a few more bars inside and will help hold you over longer.  They come packaged in a simple no-frills container that'll easily fit in virtually any storage space you have available.  Really can't go wrong with this delicious snack.",positive
This stuff is not even edible! It has this off taste of petroleum. I read that happens when a hot product is put into plastic. I don't actually know why this tastes so very awful but I certainly don't want to eat anything that tastes like when I put into my gas tank. To make matters worse it's not even returnable!,negative
Delicious! I came back from Japan last week and this tastes just like matcha from Japan!,positive
I have always liked this tea.  Very Hard to find locally so I was happy to find it on Amazon.,positive
Just tomatoes is a great brand. the freeze dried stuff are awesome with cereal and as snacks. Would love to have a bigger tub or multi tubs deal.,positive
I used the erythritol in baking.  Great product!,positive
"Excellent product, but not bottle style as ordered. I know I’m fussy, but I do prefer the bottle style to drink out of, instead I got the small package 11 ounce containers. This should be stated in the description when people order, a little misleading.",positive
"Seriously yummy stuff here.  I'm not a big fan of spicy foods, but this has just enough heat to sweet ratio.  Get some!",positive
This was the first candy that the kids grabbed from the candy bar,positive
What is shown in the pics is not the same ingredients in the plant snacks that I received. The ones received have corn and mushroom ingredients which I am highly allergic to and would never have purchased these if the pics were accurate to the product I thought I was purchasing. Would like to return they are unopened but no refunds so will have to donate. Just wanted to let consumers know before they purchase.,negative
AWESOME!  If you have a peppermint patty fetish - this is definitely your nirvana!,positive
This stuff made me incredibly ill,negative
I will buy keep going continuereally good quality for RS 2Thank you seller,positive
"I didn't realize how much I liked Maruchan until they took it off Walmart shelves and I went trying all sorts of different alternatives. A ""premium"" ramen might beat the Maruchan by itself, but the thing is, nothing else will best budget ramen with an egg and hot sauce like Maruchan.Now for the real Amazon review: It's nice to see Maruchan still being sold on Amazon, just gotta watch out for the price hike. Don't buy Maruchan at $10+. A box of 24 packages is worth $8 at MOST. I saved my favorite to my list until I was able to get it for a whopping $5.",positive
"Received December 13th and the expiration date is December 4th for one flavor and is Dec 18, 2018 for another flavor.  The third flavor expires January 1st.  Disappointing.",negative
Loved that there is finally a tasty alternative to dairy queso. I ❤ this!,positive
"If you love dark roast, this is a perfect variety pack. You get surprised with each one you get!",positive
"Even though the ingredients mentioned says it's just unhulled  100% raw sesame seeds, I don't understand why it is so runny. Either some oil must have been added, hence 1 star",negative
"I most liked the taste, this is my fifth time for ordering this product.  In between, I always try other marzipan and am always disappointed because it just doesn't taste the way this marzipan does.  From the first bite to the end of the loaf it is a wonderful oral sensation.  It is so smooth, not too sweet, just right.  Buying this product is the best decision you can make if you are looking for the very best marzipan because you have found it here.",positive
These are the closest in quality to Nespresso pods I have been able to find in over two years.  Thank you for a great product at a more reasonable price!!,positive
Lots of sand in the salt. Was not able to use for cooking. Will never buy again.,negative
Had to throw out. Was spoiled.,negative
They changed the flavor and kept the name. It’s terrible and absolutely not worth buying. Of course now I’m stuck with the case because the seller doesn’t accept returns.,negative
"Ordered these to do some small arrangements for my cousins bridal shower, it was perfect! 12 huge blooms came right on time for the party. Can’t beat the price, great value for money! Will definitely be ordering again.",positive
"Got this to attempt to make a version of butterbeer that wasn’t so incredibly sweet and it worked like a charm! My only, very minor, complaint is that it’s a little dark in color and turns everything brown, as opposed to the gold color you’d expect from butterscotch. It tastes and smells amazing, though!",positive
I like the packaging because it is not excessive. I transfer it to an airtight container and the empty package doesn't take up any space in my recycling can. I like being able to buy in larger quantities because I do a lot of cooking and it seems like I am buying spices all the time.,positive
It is very good. Just like the name brand. Will buy again.,positive
A healthy delightful snack!,positive
"Quick ship, very tasty and loaded with protein and fiber",positive
These are great. They have a good flavor.,positive
"I’m not sure why so many people are saying how horrible this product tastes... I think it tastes great and the sodium content is minimal, so it’s a win. When I make mine, I use two scoops in about 3 cups of water in a sauce pan, and I add two scoops of collagen, one scoop of unflavored bone broth protein (dr. Axe brand for both) some sea salt, and a dash of turmeric, black peppercorn, garlic powder, and cumin. For as expensive as bone broth is, this honestly is the way to go. It’s there whenever you need it, takes five minutes if that, and you don’t have to worry about it going bad. I just wish they made a size even larger than this.",positive
This is excellent quality Toor Dal or lentil because it cooks very quickly. The quality is excellent and the quantity is plenty. This lentil almost has a sweet taste to it when cooked as Sambar which is delicious. Highly recommended by me.,positive
"I bought this to use specifically for a fault line cake, and it was my very first time using a luster dust ever, and had such great results! I just mixed a small amount of vodka with the gold and the color was exactly what I was looking for.",positive
Such amazing quality. Wish the delivery driver wouldve knocked tho. Wild animals are all around waiting to devour this kind of free meal. Amazing meat terrible delivery.,positive
"Almost expired, best by date 8/2023, purchased 6/2023. Product label doesn't match photo on listing. No returns. I won't chance eating almost expired fish. I really was looking forward to trying this product but there are unknowns and I will throw away.",negative
Why did I buy these?  I can't stop eating them.  So good.,positive
Just ok missing labels and instructions,negative
one of the worst coffee mate I have ever tried,negative
Definitely wakes you up! Strong delicious coffee so glad we tried it! Best cup of coffee,positive
"I bought mostly for the sesame sticks, but everything was delicious!",positive
Very different from the store. Has zero flavor.,negative
One of my favorite grab and go snacks! I love the clean ingredients and sweet but not overly sweet flavor,positive
"I like tuna but have been hesitant because of the mercury content, this is a good substitute if all the claims are true.  I like that I don't have to drain the tuna, everything is good.",positive
"These bars are awesome.  I like the nuts and seeds as opposed to the ingredients in other Keto bars.  The variety pack  is nice so that I have different versions to choose from.  Agree with others that they are a little pricey for what you get, but I like them so much will definitely continue to order these. Highly recommend.",positive
good variety and I can almost keep up with my kids demand!,positive
"I can go to PJs and get two 48oz. jars for $10.50,  This is a very good product, however why is it so expensive on Amazon?  I saved $8.00 with BJs",positive
"Great Selection of flavors, the only problem was there was only one if each",positive
We love Ghirardelli chocolate products. This is a nice addition to our regular lighter chocolate cocoa powder. far richer in flavor.,positive
"Boxed was crushed and broken, contents not salvageable!",negative
"I ate it the night that I got it delivered. When i ate it, it tasted unfresh and salty. After about 2 hours, I felt sick and nauseous and threw up...",negative
"I had had high hopes for this matcha powder since it was highly rated, but upon opening the packet it had an extremely stale smell, and the taste of the matcha was extremely stale/sour as well. I have ordered matcha powder online several times before, but have never had this experience. Perhaps it was a bad batch, but unacceptable either way.",negative
"I found this grape lace licorice to be exactly what I was looking for. I have had different licorice at state firs but it was too chewy. This product is perfect. I will be ordering more in the near future. Can't wait to get the black lace licorice for comparison.Stephen from Western Mass, USA",positive
"I had the Strawberry Red Ice Tea when I was in Luray, Virginia and I loved it!  For 20 oz bottle with 24 in the case for $46 is reasonable, considering a 20 oz bottle of Pepsi is $2.50 to $3.00 per bottle.",positive
"These were moist and I worried about mold.  They were not good.  Sorry, love nuts, but not these.  Certainly not deluxe in any way I could see.",negative
Great for the price. Good testing coffee,positive
I received the bottles shrink wrapped together with no color wheel or box.  The listing looks completely different than what I received.,negative
"It always tastes so fresh and authentic.  The course grind gives a little chewier texture, but we love it!",positive
"I was bit skeptical before ordering but since it's a good price, I gave a shot. I am happy that they didn't use lots of unnecessary plastics. There are 24 packs of seaweed snacks in the box. Flavor is nice and clean, it's not overly salty. I personally think it has a good thickness to it when I take a bite. One pack is only 10 calories and in fact, it's organic. It'll be a good late night healthy snack for me.",positive
They are amazing!  It's mostly a nectarine flavor but then at the end the pomegranate bursts through. Soft and chewy alot like a starburst but softer. They are so tasty! Such great flavor for such a great price!,positive
"I love this product...so much flavor. I use it in salad to baste chicken, and mix it rice. For some reason my local stores don't have this flavor so I'll just keep ordering",positive
"I found these while trying to find a low calorie protein drink with a decent amount of protein in it. This is a winner! I love the vanilla cappuccino taste. For only 180 calories you're getting your caffeine fix as well as 10grams of protein to start your day, its a win/win! I highly recommend this shake!",positive
I was not able to find these in the grocery store so I was excited to see them on Amazon. It's a great tasting sugar alternative.,positive
The Toasted Marshmallow Mocha has really great flavor. It is definitely worth buying. I will be buying again and i 💯 recommend this,positive
They’re Nerds.  I mean what else can I say?  They’re awesome. They’re delicious. They’re Nerd-a-luscious. ... and the price isn’t too bad.,positive
A nice flavorful and long lasting chew.,positive
"Just like from the machines, but even better. Perfect consistency and taste. Love them!",positive
These are a nice chip and have a crisp crunch. They seem less salty than other chips I have tried in the past. The seller packaged these well so they arrived undamaged. The package size contains enough chips to have at multiple times and has enough for entertaining for a chip and dip platter.,positive
This is by far the best seasoning I have ever tasted! Would recommend highly. Thanks deermestfordinner on the suggestion!,positive
This cake has a dense and tender crumb. The aroma of vanilla is so strong when you open the package and the flavor of rum and vanilla are balanced with the buttery goodness of this cake.I’m a fan of rum cake and always get a bunch when I go on cruises. This did not disappoint. I can’t wait until dessert tomorrow night to have another piece.,positive
Super gross taste and texture!!! I make my own “Fat Bombs” and these are horrid!!!I wish I could get my money back!!’n,negative
A reliable source of Vitamin B-17 for those of you who believe it has health values.,positive
Best water hands down!!,positive
The flavor is amazing! And a great price,positive
I love eating these figs.,positive
"This chocolate dark bar is dreamy!  I am a diabetic, so have had to just stop buying chocolate bars as they are my weakness.  I bought these because I have a recipe for them.  But... I ate a whole one over the course of the day when I received them.  Must.. stop.. and.. save.. for .. cooking.  I didn't know how I would like the dark Cacao, but had read reviews that for those of us milk chocolate bar lovers, 60 percent Caco was a good place to start with dark chocolate.  Turned out to be Spot on! Edited to add:  One problem. I have opened a second bar and it is broken into pieces.",positive
We always run out of maple brown sugar at work.. not anymore!,positive
This was a wonderful soup for a cool evening.,positive
"No longer just used as an addition to lime jello, it can turn a boxed. cake miss into a lovely dessert.  Use your imagination!",positive
This bacon falls apart and crumbles making it difficult to dry. Tried two packs so will not buy again,negative
"The new and so-called ""improved"" wraps smell rancid (almost like paint) and taste nearly as bad. I can't believe this is what they chose to replace an already perfect product. Leave well-enough alone. The original recipe was DELICIOUS! If they really felt the need to sell this product, it should have been an additional new product, not a replacement. I hope they bring back the original recipe.",negative
Love it just wish it was a little more affordable,positive
Not at all what I was expecting. They tasted very sweet and the texture was like a gummy bear not a Turkish delight.,negative
"Since I grew up in Louisiana, I saw this on Amazon and started to order it every month as needed.  It is cheaper and better than most other coffees without losing it flavor.  In N.O., they fix it by adding hot milk to the hot coffee. It comes out in a double spigot at the same time. Awesome.  Ah, a touch of home for me as now I live in Florida.",positive
Made a great special Valentine's treat for the grandkids!,positive
"This is second time I ordered from this company.  I really injoy Coffee ,the price is reasonable.  The K-Cup variety is a good mixture.  The package arrived in three days on both orders.  I would order again from this company.",positive
None of the chocolates were in their place holder and half of the chocolate was old/discolored.,negative
"Looked beautiful on our daughter's cake.  I did not put it on myself, so I can't speak to the ease of using it.  I dropped it off at the cake place and they designed a cake around it.",positive
This product makes perfect sangria to be a hit at any party. My guests loved it!,positive
"Makes the most wonderful Hummis and is sooo yummy !!  The price is the very cheapest you can get, will buy again !",positive
This were so good and I knew they would be because I have had the original one's before. I wasn't sure if I would like the spicy one but I did. I will definitely buy this product again.,positive
"Stop reading reviews and just buy this.  Look at it as an investment in your home cooking palate.  I live in NYC and am a huge authentic curry fiend, been all over testing all the local places, as well as some not-so-local places (been to india, loved it)...this curry rivals or exceeds the quality of the food you'll find in a restaurant.Making this is the easiest thing in the world: cut up meat, empty packet and water into pot, cook for a few hours, enjoy.This should be made with regular lamb shoulder or even blade chop meat, cooked for 2 hours or more, with less water than recommended, and then a little bit of light coconut milk added at the end to thicken up the curry.  A little rice or naan and you're all set.",positive
"We use mac oil for roasting veggies on the grill. It has a high heat tolerance and a wonderful, subtle flavor. We love it. Like that we got two cans, as it can keep better while we use it up. Very pleased.",positive
This is excellent and fresh coffee. I have compared it to many Italian and American expressions-type coffees and it is far superior.,positive
"This candy looked really interesting and I thought it was going to be tart or sour. What I didn't expect were little packets of lemon flavored salt. That's literally all this is. It shouldn't even be called candy :( If you are looking for popcorn seasoning this might not be so bad but to just pour into your mouth and eat, GROSS!!",negative
This is great to put in Frappuccinos to make them nice and thick or smoothies as well.  Try it and you'll see.,positive
Nice enough to give as gifts.  Get a fancy jar and lid but keep plenty for yourself!,positive
Even my kids hate them. Tastes like medicine,negative
"My fruitcake arrived promptly, and in good condition. Tastes great, too! I probably order again, in the near future.It's hard to find in regular stores at this time.",positive
I was pleasantly surprised that the crystal trees light up. My daughter was super excited about the entire kit.,positive
I absolutely love Tea Drops product.  No mess. No Fuss.  Just enough sweet.  Highly recommend this product.,positive
Very good!All of them are awesome!,positive
We had gotten pecans from this company previously.  They were so good and fresh that when we neededcashews we made it a point to order from them again.  Excellent quality.  We will diffinetly order from themagain.  thank you,positive
The ingredient list on the bottle is quite a bit different from what’s listed here. The description doesn’t list wheat as an ingredient but says it may contain TRACES of flour. The first ingredient on the bottle is wheat. If you’re looking to overpay for a small amount of flour I suppose this product is for you.,negative
"MANNNNN THESE ARE MY GUYS RIGHT HERE, LEGAL CHEESE CRACK",positive
I LOVE pepper now that I am in my 60's. And I can tell you this i the BEST pepper and at a GREAT price. Plus I received it EARLY!!!  Great job Amazon.,positive
These cough drops work to calm a cough and sooth a sore throat. I can’t be with my children or grandchildren so I send these to them when school starts. There’s a little love in the delivery. I’m hoping that the silver is helping it seems like they relieve cold symptoms.,positive
This water is disgusting,negative
EVERYBODY LOVED THESE!,positive
"It smells and tastes like anise, NOT sweet basil. Tastes terrible. The sad thing is it's not returnable. So i'm out the money. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Misleading.",negative
more harsh then flavorfulshould be more like a pickled taste,positive
Great flavor!  Best flavored coffee I ever had.,positive
"I used to buy this in Germany, so glad I found it on Amazon at a reasonable price, it came faster than predicted. They taste fresh and I love them",positive
I love these but for some reason mine tasted stale ...,negative
"I'm not a tea person, but this tea is one i love to drink. The flavor is on point.",positive
Unimpressed. I could not tastes the sweet potato or really the cinnamon it them Was very disappointed.,negative
The candy came today had white all over milk chocolate and the bag was opened,negative
Looked exactly as promised. Very pleased.,positive
After eating a few I got an intestinal bug,negative
I like this coffee because it never upsets my stomach.,positive
I gave this as a Holiday gift with a recipe to make hot chocolate. The giftee  was totally thrilled and said it make the ultimate hot chocolate,positive
It’s good but tiny,positive
One of the best raspberry jams I’ve ever eaten !,positive
"This stuff really works! I was able to make bright, truly red cookie icing. There was no weird flavor. This is the only food coloring I've found that actually produces a deep red.",positive
Love this sauce. It’s perfect for many BBQ items especially ribs. Not too sweet and just the right amount of warmth,positive
"Out of the package, the ""granola bites"" were more like a ""granola ball"". They were all clumped together as a singular mass...not a great start. The manufacturer should either invest in alternative packaging or consider a non-sticky coating for the bites.Unfortunately, the worst part was the flavor. I realize taste is subjective, but these ""oats and peanut"" bites were terrible (my wife had the same negative opinion). I am not certain if the nuts were rancid or it's just the B'cuz recipe/ingredients, but the taste was quite off-putting. The bites were not sweet at all nor peanut-forward at all; very disappointing.However, the texture was fine. Also, the calorie/nutritional content was acceptable for a suggested serving of 6 bites. I just wish they tasted better. Overall, I suppose these bites might be edible If you have dietary restrictions and need a gluten-free snack...but in my opinion, there are better alternatives available.",negative
"As it turns out, 5lbs of candy is too much candy.",positive
Terrible bread! Hard as a rock! Goes straight in the trash!,negative
"Another daughter's present, but haven't heard anything about it.",positive
So happy with product. Got flakes soon than promised...always a good thing!,positive
Product is great.  Unfortunately USPS can't locate our address and refuses to deliver even though UPS has no problem.,negative
This is the BEST stuff ever! I love fresh horseradius but this is even better! A little dab will do you,positive
These brownies taste great for being low carb!! So delicious! Worth every penny.,positive
"Low quality product, no returns allowed",negative
"Ordered this after I picked one up on a whim at a Royal Farms in Virginia. I am skeptical about the taste of healthy drinks, but this is awesome!",positive
More than half of these came with broken bags!,negative
So delicious better than I thought,positive
"Quality product, great price, fast delivery.....all I could wish for!",positive
Perfect for work and travel.,positive
Did not like the taste of these and will not buy again,negative
"Nice, mild coffee. The flavor is pleasant; it still tastes like coffee.",positive
Great as always! but thought I ordered the really big ones these were the medium ones. I wanted the bigger smarties! Still great tho-,positive
Me encantó para mi pan de avena con frutas y nueces.  Queda Espectacular!!!  👍,positive
Loved the apple flavor,positive
Very dry and tasteless!,negative
"I love them. I eat a lot of nuts and seeds and I like adding dried fruit, but what is available in the grocery store is full of sugar, these are just blueberries.",positive
"These are so easy to make and taste pretty good. They whip up in about 12 minutes total, mix and bake. Great for quick dessert on a busy night.",positive
"I need to drink decaf now after drinking coffee since I was 3 years old in 1966. I have to get off caffeine for health reasons. Had NEVER heard of water decaf until recently. I have never found a decaf I like in over a decade so I have shunned coffee for the most part. THIS isn't BENZENE decaf, a dangerous chemical, this is decaffeinated with WATER. Not only safe but the full flavor comes through! I LOVE my coffee and now I can drink it safely again. I am 59 years young, lol, I KNOW what I am talking about. If you want FULL FLAVOR, this is the bomb!",positive
"These are so good and hit the spot.  If I’m late, and can’t make breakfast, any of these flavors are a perfect substitute.  They are also awesome for the late night, watching TV cravings I get!!",positive
How it has such high ratings is amazing to me.  Perhaps my taste buds are in the small percentage of those who find this disgusting.  It is so sweet that it tastes as if it has artificial flavoring in it.  NO taste of lemon or ginger.  It tastes like sweet water with an aftertaste of my backyard.  Gross. Gross. Gross. I'm returning it.,negative
The nuts arrived quickly and fresh. All the nuts were delicious especially the Honey Glazed Pecans which was everyone's favorite.,positive
Excellent texture and taste. Perfect with my morning coffee.,positive
Very tasty. I enjoy this syrup and it’s sweet and flavorful.,positive
"I was disappointed in flavor. I thought it was rather weak. However, the low acid promise was good.",negative
"The quality still appears to be there. It's been years since we were in Chicago and the treat of the day was getting Frangos at Marshall Fields downtown.  We thought they were no more, but, thanks to the web, we got some this Christmas. Excellent in every way.",positive
yum. these are my favorite almonds. I have them on regular delivery and could not get along without them on a daily basis. very flavorful,positive
Love this product.  I have followed a low carb lifestyle for years and this is a great product for pasta.  I have made chicken Alfredo or spaghetti and homemade mac and cheese using these noodles.  If you are looking for a low carb pasta this is the pasta for you!!,positive
"The only reason I purchased this coffee was for its advertised high caffeine content. Being that the beans are selected and roasted by the same company, it is in no way high octane like Death Wish. The only thing strong about Valhalla Java is the way it makes your piss smell!",negative
"I've been drinking coconut juice (CJ) for about two years now, on and off, depending on what I can get my hands on through the local drink aisles. I've tried roughly 10 different brands and always come back to Amy & Brian. The price is about the same as all others, however the quality/taste is better. Based on my personal taste-test, most CJ brands seem to over process the juice, leaving it either too sweet, or with too much 'nut' flavor (guessing that is due to species or age of coconut). Amy & Brian is very light and refreshing, with a perfect blend of sweetness and pulp. Go with Amy & Brian and thank me later.On a side-note ~ I do feel all of these CJ drinks are grossly overpriced.",positive
THESE TASTE AMAZING. Never thought organic could taste this good. These are very popular with our kids.,positive
"This multi pack has great flavors Cinnamon,Pecan Pie, and even pumpkin spice!!! Yummy",positive
"Adds great ginger sweetness- not too overpowering- used in coffee, on cereal, in oatmeal - adds a slight sweetness to anything- use your imagination !",positive
Yeast is something you can usually need in a hurry. This fits the bill. It us a proven product.,positive
"Do not buy! Advertised as 10 bags.  In reality, it was just one 6.5 oz bag.  What a ripoff!",negative
This is my third time buying these and this time what I got was (mostly) in just a zip lock with a bar code label.  Bag was open when it arrived w 1/3 of it in the box - complete mess when I opened it.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS - plenty of other vendors for pepper.,negative
"I was disappointed when reading the ingredients, to find YEAST EXTRACT (a sneaky term for MSG). The flavored ones have this will not be be purchasing them any longer. Only the plain blue pack does not have MSG. Buyer beware.",negative
Just like the store. As some people complained about before with them melting I ordered 10 boxes and they all are intact and unmelted had cold packs in with the package to prevent from over heating this was in the summer in Washington was about 75 out.,positive
good...to good....,positive
It was completely melted and a big glob of goo,negative
Quantity for the price,positive
good for clearing the throat.,positive
"The case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price. I expected a ""Based on the true story"" movie only to find a shot on home video hodge-podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non-related slaughter house scenes. The video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects. I started this review before I was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but, low and behold it only got worse. If I could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten. Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one.",negative

"I was looking forward to these however disappointed when they arrived. I was hoping for soft, fresh, plump, mullberries but these are not. These are dried, crunchy, hard , and are difficult to chew. I will not ever buy them from this brand again, not only will I not buy any mullberries from them I would be very hesitant to purchase any products from Terrasoul.  My purchase included 2 bags of mullberries & they both were the same, extremely dried out, like they were 10years old but yet the expiration date was still good:-(",negative
Good Stuff!  On my second bottle and it's worth every dime spent.,positive

The ring is too big for children with small fingers and the quality is not the best. You can barely see the images on the ring. Definitely make sure you don't plan to use these as your only Thank You gift for the party. They'll be thrown away before the party is over.,negative
"The flour is extremely fresh and almost malty smelling. The company grinds it to order once you place an order and ships it quickly. I haven’t tried other einkorn products but this one is so fresh and good, I can’t imagine others could be any better. I’d like it if it were a little cheaper but you are paying for quality.",positive
I got this for my granddaughter s birthday .. it was awesome  .  I will buy it again 😊,positive
"My wife is from the Emerald Isle so she loves these “crisps,”as she says. They arrived earlier than expected and my wife said they were fresh. Due to the pandemic our specialty shops had a hard time staying open let alone stocking the Irish Snacks. So when she was down to her last few bags of cheese and onion flavored crisps I place an order and a short time later they arrived, fresh and crispy!! Happy Wife in the Real Gotham",positive

I have tried each flavor and each one tastes like a chemical and not coffee.  And I am not a coffee snob.  Not sure how the reviews are so high and the flavor is so bad.,negative
"I decided to try the simply version because it had almost half the sodium than the regular, and had less sugar :). I was really impressed and have absolutely no issue with it! It tasted great, a little less salty than the regular creamy, but even that wasn't very noticeable. I'm going to continue to buy the simply version since I'm watching my sodium intake. I'd highly recommend giving this version a try! :D",positive

"Tuscan whole milk. Tuscan whole milk. The words haunted me, I knew not why. In my dreams, in my waking hours. Always Tuscan whole milk. What was this ambrosia foretold in my nighttime? Where would I find it? And would it satisfy my rarified tastes?For days, weeks, months I wandered like a starved zombie through the streets of my home city greedy for the answers to my questions. I lied, I cheated, I stole, I murdered and was no nearer the truth. Until one day, I was told of a wondrous 'virtual' word called 'teh Internets'. I, after many days of intensive instruction, learned how to launch a 'search' on 'teh internets' and found Tuscan whole milk on Amazon. Yes, Amazon. Which I had previously believed to be a river, was now, as they say, 'online'. And on this online (no doubt virtual) river I found Tuscan whole milk.I ordered some. I did. My hands trembled as I did so, so great was my excitement. Imagine how much greater my excitement was when the product eventually arrived.It arrived. I opened it. I drank it. I was enlightened and immediately achieved a serene oneness with the Universe.",positive
"I was sooo happy to find out I could order this bbq sauce from Amazon! As a kid, I use to visit the restaurant that created this masterpiece every summer. It's my favorate bbq sause ever! It is a venegar based sauce, with a little heat to it. It's not thick, and just right for baisting food as it cooks on the grill. Although the restaurant has closed, I am very happy to know that I can still enjoy it as much as I ever did.",positive
"Haven't tried the peppers yet, but package was delivered fast and in good shape. They even look hot!!! Going surprise some friends with hot chili dog sauce!!",positive

I have used these seeds to make some really fantastic mustard and to make some pickled mustard seeds. Great product.,positive
Not even worth leaving a 1 star review. 11.00 for one medium bag. Just for the chips to be all broken. Will not recommend.,negative

This is a great deal I think it is dee licious and the sprinkles are absolutely wonderful my grandkids love the extra,positive
Omg! So good. These vegan Buffalo wings are addictive!,positive
Terrible taste and texture. I even blended fruit with it and I couldn’t hide the bitter cocoa taste. Do yourself a favor and buy Vega brand.,negative
"I purchased these thinking that stevia is usually a safe ingredient for fructose malabsorption, but the gummies also have natural flavors, and these wreck my stomach.  Honestly, getting some Haribo gummy bears, and just having a few, is a better buy in my book.",negative

All broken and not returnable. Just wow.,negative
Its too wet and soft (soggy). Im returning this product. Not as what they advertised. It should be dry.. not wet and soft (soggy),negative
The product itself was great and made a wonderful pizza dough. But the expiry date was only a week away from the day I received the flour. I think I should have been delivered a product with more shelf life.,negative
A little more than you would pay  but for the convenience of getting a little birthday surprise it was so worth it !!!!,positive
It arrived with quite visible mold on the strawberries.  Where is quality check??!,negative
"I bought this to make mango icecream. The can is pretty big, so I had left over for 4 or 5 more batches.....very tasty, you can pretty much eat out of can. In sure oyu can use for other stuff like drinks or milkshakes....My icecream came out delicious, specially I cant find fresh mango where I live.",positive
Tasty and so easy to make!  We always have it in our hurricane supplies.  Can serve alone or over rice or noodle/pasta.,positive
"I got hooked on these when I was in England, and they're so hard to find in the US. McVities often imports the plain HobNobs or those with Milk Chocolate, but these dark chocolate beauties are the ones I live for.",positive
"This quinoa turns to mush when cooked. I am a natural foods chef and have been using quinoa for years fir salads, pilaf etc. and this stuff is dirty , needs to be rinsed several times and when cooked at a ratio of 1 to 1 and 1/4 turns to mush, good only for soups, or quinoa pudding( which I made and was delicious ) not good for salads tough an d that is what I love to make with quinoa.",negative
"It does not have a good flavor at all, i probably had 20 different brands of energy drinks this is the worst. Hands down.",negative

"I thought this would be the alternative to buying the boxes of 3 or 4 a couple of times and then loading up after Easter on the clearance.  My husband knows I have them and there is no way that the box will last even until Easter, let alone after!  I will be buying these again!",positive
These are 100% lentils and taste great! I love having them as a healthier alternative to traditional pasta. Make sure not to over cook - it really only takes 4-6 minutes.,positive
"I absolutely loved this meal, but I also tweaked it to fit my own taste preferences.I don't believe Mint belongs in pasta so out the mint went, and I don't like red pepper so I didn't add it either. Just because the ingredient is provided, doesn't mean you HAVE to use it.Now, otherwise, I thought it was plenty of food. I live alone and definitely have enough for a second night's dinner or a lunch. Really enjoyed the taste. Wish there was a little less packaging, and could have used a little more ricotta, but will DEFINITELY be ordering this again.",positive
Update:  customer service was great reached out to me and sent me a new bag and it is great must have had a bad bag before.  5 stars for coffee and how quick they are to make sure you get quality coffee if something is off.Coffee came smelt good but once brewed it tasted Stale and old.  Grinds were very dry and there is no option for exchange.  I don’t ever do reviews but this coffee is bad and I had high hopes.,positive
"I love how glittery this was. It could stand to be a little thicker paper used, but overall I was very pleased.",positive
The taste and the convenience of it and made a nice centerpiece,positive

Treat yourself to the joyous experience of Lavazza Super Crema, and savor the moments of pure coffee bliss it brings to your day.",positive
"For those expecting to really taste the pepper and sea salt, you might want to look a bit further before settling on this bar. While you can taste the salt right away it is quickly overwhelmed by the chocolate. The pepper is sadly indiscernable which may be because the spioes are not mixed into the chocolate but are lightly layered onto the bottom of the bar. Well-crafted overall, but disappointing otherwise.",negative
"This machine has been perfect! I've used it for 2 parties and it has worked perfect! Pops the popcorn perfect, is a good size...not to small and not to big to set up for a party. It's also been easy to keep clean! Would definitely recommend!",positive

I've used several brands of coconut oil for a moisturizer. This brand is on par with the others if not a bit smoother. I would buy again.,positive
I love the Propel! Propel doesn't like me. It's sweetened with sucralose. It has a laxative effect on me. If you can tolerate sucralose I 100% recommend. My favorite is the lemon.,positive

Arrived on time in fresh condition.,positive
"Normally I don't buy spices on line but in this case, I could not find white peppercorns where we live and I likely checked about 10 different stores including Whole Paycheck before breaking down and buying these.  Local stores carried ground peppercorns but not the whole one.  One small shop that carries spices and teas just said they had but the demand was so low it wasn't worth it.The peppercorns arrived very quickly and are great.  Good flavor, nothing questionable with them at all, definitely recommended.  The size of the bag we got will last us a long time before I'm going to have to look for more.",positive
This candy is OLD! It is all hard and the chocolate ones are  cracked and discolored. Seems like it is years old. Do not purchase!,negative

"These are delicious. I bought a small package at a local store, and liked them so much I bought a box of 12 on Amazon. I got the white cheddar and nacho flavors.  They are similar to a cheeto, but much better. They are more dense, have less dust, have less calories, half the fat, and about 2.5 times the protein. I love them.  If you're going to snack, this is a much better way to go.  Delicious.",positive

"Hats off to the Brooklyn Beans Variety Pack as well as my favorite the French Roast! I tried the poor tasting Tully's French Roast for the Vue a while back and was worried the Brooklyn Beans Kcup version may be as terrible. Since I really like French Roast coffee that was an issue but I was pleasantly surprised when I found a nicely balanced dark roast that is just the way I like it. I have even given some away to friends and family members just so they can try it themselves.Overall everything in the Variety Pack except the Fuggedaboudit was to my liking and everyone else's. Ironically I cannot say I like the Fuggedaboudit in the least bit, it's too Earthy to the point it reminds me of dirt but the rest I have tried are Very good to Excellent and for a variety pack that is what matters most.To anyone that checks this review out, these guys are definitely worth trying out and I would not be surprised if you become a big fan like I am. And next time I'm in NYC I know where I'll be going to get some fresh coffee! (if they have a storefront)UPDATE 5/10/13: The Fuggedaboudit was fine in the most recent batch I received. After trying a second kcup I figured out that batch in the assortment was either really old when I received it or more likely way over roasted to the point it had a burnt smell as well as had that Earthy dirt flavor. The new ones do not have that and taste fine if you like stronger more bold coffees. I do, so hopefully will not run into a batch like the last ones again.  :)",positive
"Very good product, have too say they tasted much better than i thought they would.",positive

"I use this mint for ""guests"" that come in my office or we have meetings with a few people - you know - some people need it.  :-)Some people have hesitated to pick it - assuming that it's candy (instead of mint) --- my suggestion is to seal each end of the wrapping, instead of having the twisted ends...it would change the perception.I like the light, but effective mint flavor of this candy --- and it does not have the ""stuck on your tongue"" film after it's gone.I've also used this candy when I feel a bit motion sick while in a plane --- it is soothing.One bag lasts me about 2 months --- stash in my purse and office.  Will definitely order some more.",positive
"MY FIRST TIME BUYING THIS SNACK FRESH, SHOULD HAVE ORDERED 2..",positive
Delicious snack! I love this with yogurt!! So good!,positive
"My husband and I eat a raw nut mix every morning. When he complained about the almonds (from another company), I replaced them with Anna and Sarah almonds because I had liked their brazil nuts. Almonds are great.",positive
I am so disappointed in this collection of fall coffee flavors.  I even set my brew on 8 oz strong and barely could taste coffee. I won’t even give this away I would be too embarrassed!! Nor will I return for it to be sold to someone else.You messed up Victor Alan. Shame on you.,negative

"I have had their Chocolate Brownie flavor, so I was glad they now have additional flavors.  All the flavors are delicious.  They taste like CLIF Bars, but the one difference is that these are Soy-Free.  CLIF bars are not soy free.  They are also filling, so perfect for hikes and after school snacks.  In fact, my husband ate one before going to the gym and stated he felt more energetic during the workout.  Looking at the ingredients list, I see nothing that is artificial.  The sweetener used is organic maple syrup.  There are about 21 grams of carbs in each bar, so not for those looking to cut down carbs.The Best By dates range from June 2023 to December 2023.  All six bars were gobbled up within 3 days.  I had to fish a discarded wrapper in the trash bin, so I could write a review!  If you’re looking for natural ingredients in an energy bar, then these are for you.",positive

"I prefer the lyte body armors to the regular! They are perfect for breastfeeding mamas, it helps keep you hydrated which helps with supply!",positive
"I purchased these yesterday for student fund raiser. This was the first and last time for such a purchase. The expiration date is for August 2018. This is March so they should have been good. They were dry and hard. They tasted stale with the first bite. There was no taste of butter or pecans present. If it had been a store purchase, I would have returned the 2 remaining unopened boxes. I then examined the cookies. None had any visible pecan chips or fragments on the surface. I broke open 6 cookies. I found a total of 7 dark fragments that may or may not have been pecans. The fragments were smaller then a nail clipping from a toddler! Breaking open all the cookies would have yielded less then a quarter of one pecan half. There is about 16 cookies in box. I looked at the ingredients. Pecans were listed as last ingredient brfore the less then 2% ingredients. Butter is made from dairy. Non-fat-dried milk is listed as the last ingredient. Cheap discount store animal cookies have better flavor then these.",negative
"I love Red Bull and have bought it from Amazon 20+ times for the value and convenience but I’m going to the store for my next purchase. The last 3 + deliveries have been terrible. Leaking cans, flat drink, less flavor like it was old. Quality is definitely not what it was and I buy cases at a time.",negative
"I love love love this tea.  I have had other dandelion tea in the past that I couldn’t drink even with sugar or honey, but this tea, I can drink straight without any additives.  The draw backs from this product is a tendency for the string to come out of the satchel and for some of the tea to break free and settle at the bottom of the cup leaving me unable to drink until the last drop (only sometimes, not all the time), but these are minor inconveniences for such a delicious tea. I have already finished my single box and ordered the 5 box pack!!",positive
Absolutely delicious. My only complaint is that the packages are pretty small so I go through like 3 of them before I feel like it's enough.:p,positive
"A Dishonor to the Name Suzy Q'sHad an Occasion to purchase two Boxes of the (8) Individually Wrapped Cakes and was really looking forward to trying one as a Dessert after Dinner, and having two of my Grandson’s try for the first time.  What a disappointment.  First if you look at the photo I attached, compare the Suzy Q pictured on the Box and the (3) that I opened.  I should have placed the top-bottom next to each other however I think you can tell which is the other pair.  That is the “Creamy Filling” that you get, it barely even covers ½ the cake and is so thin it cannot even be seen until you pull them apart.  Thought it may have been a fluke however each and every one was like that, one worse than the other.  Tried one anyway and the texture and taste, (if that is what you call it), did not even taste like Chocolate and the cake looks fake.  I remember having them as a kid and the filling would ooze out the other end while eating.  They really missed the Boat on this one, horrible.",negative
My favorite flavor at a reasonable price.,positive
"There might be peanut butter essence in these, but there is nothing even remotely resembling the actual taste of peanut butter.  They're weirdly sticky, and have an off flavor that's not quite rancid, but close.  .The chocolate chip in the original recipe *was* good,  and a blessing to Keto-ers everywhere..but they got greedy and couldn't leave well enough alone, so went messing with the recipe (calling it an improvement - nope they're now just not good), made them smaller, and doubled the price.  The only thing still edible in their entire line are the waffles.  Hopefully they won't mess with those.",negative
"taste good wish I would have seen this stuff before, instead wasting all that money on the small packets of taco mix.will be buying this from now on well worth the money shipped & rec on time. its a big bottle weighs 1.8 pounds that's a lot of taco mix.",positive
This product is a great full bodied coffee that gets you going! My husband and I both like it and drink it.,positive
Great tasting snack when craving and keeping you body fat low. I actually eat this when I'm leaning down below 7% body fat. Highly recommend!,positive
"This is a absolutely great organic whole food sweetener.  I love that it is pure and dates and has NO other ingredients.  As a sweetener, it has decent ""food"" value as opposed to maybe all other forms of sweeteners.  It really helps to love the taste of this product.  It is a great product.",positive
Apparently the contents in the container gone bad. It tastes bitter and lot of cashews look affected by insects.,negative
This was the perfect sugar substitute. I was able to make the best vegan caramel with it!,positive

"There is a lot of crumbs,very disappointed",negative
I love this candy!  It has the best peppermint aroma and the pieces are melt-in-the-mouth soft.  I offer it to guests in my office. It is fat free too.  I ordered two big tubs because it goes fast (mostly because I am always eating it).,positive
"These cashews are fresh, and delicious. The 2 lb. bag is the perfect size for me. I put them in the blender as a thickening agent when I'm pureeing soups.",positive
I can't believe the size and it smells delicious. Best buy I have had for coffee in a long time.  Thanks,positive
"Flavorful, easy to use.  use it on chicken and pork. Works well in airfryer or oven.",positive
dressing was expired when delivered,negative
"Smelled terrible when opened, but after rinsing were fine. Completely flavorless so they can be used in almost any dish. Found out they are better when first cooked on the stove to dry them out a little and then used in your recipe.",positive
I love the dark roast.,positive
"Excellent no-till cover crop, seeds sprouted within 24 hours, fully bloomed Within 48 hours, a little goes a long way, very fast shipping, highly recommended, will definitely be purchasing again...",positive
Love the flavor and have repurchased it and will reorder in the future. Much better flavor than the chocolate.,positive

I have started using this product to replace white sugar in my house. Love it love it love it.,positive
"I rave about how amazing this ghee is to everyone. Other brands do not compare! The smell and texture is nearly flawless. I have converted many family and friends to buying this ghee and using it over other saturated fats. The cost along with prime shipping makes it affordable for anyone to be healthy using this ghee. Many of my family members and even my medical doctors who practice Ayurvedic healing are now recommending and purchasing this themselves. I hope the quality, quantity, and price never changes because this is something I can be very loyal to! The packaging of this product when shipped is beyond phenomenal. It really does seem like it's packed with love. It's in a glass jar which is a huge plus since I don't use plastic anything.I never do reviews but I just needed to express my love for this company, they truly know what they're doing!",positive
Purchase arrived as promptly as indicated. Love this product.,positive

"With condensed milk, coconut milk and coconut flakes! Wooow!!!",positive
These were great but unfortunately I have to go easy on the pork.,positive
"What can I say? This stuff is awesome. (I drink too much of it.) I especially like it combined with the Good Earth Sweet & Spicy tea (I steep both in the same large mug). This stuff is great combined with other teas in this way, or just drunk 'straight'.",positive
This was a surprise for my son's KY girlfriend. She was so happy to get it!,positive
These seasonings are amazing! I love everything about the flavor and makes all my food taste great! Will definitely recommend and purchase more in the future.,positive
GREAT Value for the price and Brazil Nuts are Very fresh.,positive
a friend introduced me to this - marvelous product.  she made the BEST stew with it.,positive
"This is one of the most disappointing items I have ever bought on Amazon.  I've tried all 3 flavors, both light and medium roast and they are uniformly awful.  They have no aroma and no taste.  I still have some of my old pods of a different brand, also kona coffee, and they are much, much better.  I bought it because it was Amazon's own brand and I've had good experiences with other items that are Amazon branded, but they really dropped the ball on this one.",negative
Scott still working. Love my Kombucha!,positive
I love this product I make  Cacao drink  every day.,positive
"This is a great shortcut if you don't have the time (or the energy and resources) to make a blond and dark roux from scratch.  If you're the kind of person who does make from scratch, this base gives you the flexibility to add your own personal touch.  I've let this base stand alone and I've added my own mix of spices.  In both scenarios, everyone who ate (even some folks who've frequented New Orleans for cuisine) were honestly pleased.Of course, keep in mind, this is a shortcut.  It won't match up to true blue creole cooking, but for folks like me who live hundreds of miles from Louisiana, this is the next best thing.Amazon priced it well, keep in mind, it's a box of 12 and the expiration date might be within one year of your purchase.  While that would seem like a downside to some, I think etouffee once a month is not enough etouffee at all.",positive
Kal liquid Stevia is the best no sugar at all. Tastes delicious in tea.,positive

"I am diabetic, and stevia and monkfruit are the only drink flavors that don't raise my blood sugar. The stores around here aren't dependable in stocking Sweetleaf water drops and they're my favorite drink flavoring. The vendor I ordered these drops from mailed them the same day--- I almost never have that experience. I will order from this vendor again!",positive
Tastesn great and was quite filling.  And nothing beats the convenience of 1 minute in the microwave.,positive

I bought it as a gift for my mother.  She loved it!  Said that it was full of different goodies; it took her several weeks to finish the contents.,positive
This is the best popcorn I found yet The flavor is amazing taste just like movie theater popcorn,positive
"We used these this summer in a concession stand and it saved us a lot of money, but we felt the overall product was better. Everything is premeasured and it saves a ton of room with storage. The final product was an overall success. The popcorn wasn't to salty or greasy. It was perfect bag of popcorn. We will be using this again and I would recommend this product to anyone.",positive
We enjoy adding liquid smoke to some of our cooking.  These do the job.,positive

"Over time my body has rejected pasta made of standard wheat flour, but what's life without a little pasta? After much experimentation I deduced that Italian pasta is less troublesome (due to EU restrictions on artificial fertilizer and pesticides, but still a dietary rarity. After reading the Grain by Grain book (from Amazon) I had a different understanding of what might be the issue and how to combat it: Kamut grain either as a cooked grain or pasta! While this seems to be a bit pricey, it's well worth the money. My body has NO issues with it and the higher protein content (and no artificial fertilizers or pesticides) keeps me full longer. I'm also willing to pay a little more to buy products which are gentle on the earth. This is a good one!",positive
I like the flavor and sotness.,positive
product was received in good condition and will used very soon.,positive
My son loves caprisun!  Any flavor! But fruit punch is his favorite.,positive
"It was delicious.  I like a little chocolate in ice cream, strawberries.",positive
A recipe we had called for Kosher salt. I had no idea what Kosher salt was or why it was different. I love to use this out of a bamboo salt cellar. The salt has larger crystals than table or sea salt so you feel what you are using.,positive
I love this decaf - dark and delicious.,positive
This new flavor is great! I keep it in my purse and in my car to always have it ready for the kids.,positive

Best tasting peanuts you will ever eat.,positive
flavor  and filling,positive
I buy this honey often during the cold season. This time I bought it for throat and cough remedy. Yes lemon and tea and good nights sleep. Dr recommend buckwheats honey for flu season on our local channel so I took her advice . It coats the throat and nice size tablespoon just before sleep does the trick. Taste better than cough syrup. I like that it’s made by the Amish too seems close to God,positive
I purchased this twice from this seller. My family & guests have always loved it. Now I’m forced to use a reseller (within Amazon?) because McCormick will no longer deliver it to my address!? and the price is $5 less from the reseller! 🧐,positive
This is so bad. Why did I give it five stars? This is the only gum I have found that I can tolerate. I can't have any kind of sugar or sugar substitute. I really missed chewing gum. This is hard and there is no flavor. I think they just hold fruit over the gum so it has some of the smell of fruit. Still I chew this all day long. The only game in town as far as I know for people like me.,positive
The price and taste are just perfect!,positive
"Not very good. After eating one, it felt like my stomach was full of bricks. Adkins peanut cookies way better.",negative
Delicious white chocolate candies. Reese and Kit Kat’s were my fav,positive

"I started making handmade stuffing from scratch with handgrown herbs and my basic family never likes to differ from old school box crap. I was tired of wasting my time with making food from scratch, with fresh herbs from my garden and spending the money and time.I bought this herb version, added my own love and fresh herbs and it was delightful and we all love it. Great compromise and a hell of a lot easier for me!",positive
One of our favorite candies. Love that it’s a variety pack with multiple flavors.,positive

"I bought the dispenser and a large jar of Jelly Belly beans for my sons b'day.  I told him it was for his desk at work.  He loves these beans (as do I) but people kept ""dropping  by"" his office and helping themselves to the ones on his desk.  This way they have to pay for them.  But he also keeps the money in a dish so they don't actually pay for them but they are limited to one smaller amount than before.  He loves it and has had fun with it.",positive
We love this product but it did not travel well from Amazon.  The bread was stuck together and when we attempted to separate it ripped in multiple pieces.,negative
"I haven't used King Arthur gluten free flour enough to rate it for taste , versatility, etc. but I've read good things. For example, America's Test Kitchen recommends it as an alternative to their own mix. I've found that gluten-free cooks are partial to their own mixes though sometimes cookbooks will begrudge a nod at another mix. To tell you the truth, they're all pretty similar in my opinion.Anyway, this is a qualified recommendation based on value for money. The price for the quantity is great.",positive
This tea is amazing!! I highly recommend it. A very good robust flavor it’s actually replacing my morning coffee!,positive
"My wife and love this coffee's flavor and excellent value. We've tried many different brands, but keep coming back to this one.",positive
I dont care if you use this on meat or vegetables or even fish. This soy sauce will wow your taste buds. Its not the typical kind that you find here in America that leaves a salty after taste. It enhances the flavour of what your making and with it being organic and well made you also dont have to worry because there is no alcohol.,positive
Perfect pancake syrup! Just wish it were not in single use plastic,positive
Love it! Great value. Came to me with a cracked/broken lid but this could have been from the shipping...,positive
Love it !! Nothing to dislike very fresh and delicious!!,positive
Great product! I was worried about some of the reviews that said there were grounds in their cup but I didn't find this to be true.  I love the fact I am not throwing away so much plastic  and I like the biodegradable bags the pods come in. Great flavor great packaging great value. I will order again!!!,positive
"It was recommended as a tasty substitute for sugar,  by the health food store staff. I was told to avoid sugar, as a prediabetic. It doesn’t taste as bad as other substitutes, but it’s no 1:1 substitute for sugar. It does not taste like sugar-but is tolerable for me.Too pricy- $8 per pound-I can get 10 pounds of organic sugar for about the same price at Costco.Can’t forget why people take sugar, especially those who take several spoons with coffee-tea: those with trouble getting enough feel-good hormones in the ordinary course of the day-we under-responders-we need extra sensory stimuli- my assessment, for myself-I read-I am not a medical professional-consult Doctor, sensory integration therapist,neuroscientists!",positive
These are the best tasting vegetarian hot dogs. Even my picky granddaughter loves them! They're fast and easy to make. Best of all is the great price with free shipping!,positive
"The title just about says it all.  These crackers (crispbread, if you will) are light and airy and come in around 4 grams of carb each.  I cut them into 8 pieces with a sharp knife and use them for dips, as well as ""conveyers"" for cheese and other goodies.  They have become my favourite snack.  Yes, they are bland, but I like the fact they pick up the flavour of what they are served with and don't overpower.",positive
Really good quality and tasted really good. 1 picky eater toddler who for a while only ate chicken nuggets or cheese it’s if he ate. These he liked a lot!,positive
Our favorite coco for the Keurig.,positive

"If you buy any of the hot sauces from Small Axe Peppers via Amazon -- or directly from Small Axe based on their frequent marketing emails -- you may run into the following product-fulfillment or data-security issues, even though their sauces are all 100% delicious. From the outset of my relationship with this company, which goes back several years and spans all the way to the present, I’ve had to deal with all of the following product-fulfillment and privacy-protection issues:1) With my first order from Small Axe Peppers via Amazon several years ago now, all the bottles arrived broken because there was no insulation inside the package, and they had sent them in a lightly padded envelope. After sending me replacement bottles, this issue was eventually corrected, and they started sending bottles wrapped in enough insulation to prevent any breakage.2) Worrisomely, I suddenly started getting multiple emails from Small Axe confirming that I had placed orders with them when I actually hadn’t done so. I thought perhaps my credit card information had been compromised, but the then-Head of Operations, Daniel Fitzgerald, who more recently in 2023 has risen to the CEO level of the company, assured me that my credit card had not been hacked, but that they had used my email as a “placeholder” email in their internal order-fulfillment systems and not to worry, that it wouldn’t happen again.3) Several months later, it happened again, and I kept getting more phantom “confirmations” that I had purchased products from Small Axe, when I hadn’t, so I surfaced the concern to John A. Crotty, Small Axe’s Chairman, and indicated that I would have to make an official complaint to New York State where they were located if the practice of misusing my email address as part of the company’s internal administration systems continued, given that I had been assured my email had been removed from all their systems. I was then told that the same thing had happened to EVERYONE in their entire database, and that it definitely wouldn’t happen again. It was also implied in writing to me that I shouldn’t complain at all about them because they were a small Benefit (B) Corporation (a traditional for-profit company that also tries to do social good). Fortunately, there were no misuses of my email address after that point.4) I began to notice some other concerning aspects about Small Axe Peppers, such as the fact they had no Google or Yelp reviews at all, which I thought was pretty odd for a food-products company with a fairly long track record, only mostly glowing customer reviews from a site that I had never heard of, Yotpo.com. It’s difficult to tell whether these mostly outstanding reviews for Small Axe Peppers on that site are real or made up by someone at their company. Only one recent review includes criticism of their poor customer service and broken delivery promises from someone named Diane M. The response to Diane M. from Daniel Fitzgerald is “Sorry about the delay in your order, we were overwhelmed as a result of being featured on the Today Show. Please let me know if there is anything we can do for you in the future.”5) Last year, I placed an order directly with Small Axe for a Gift Set that came together a Small Axe T-shirt featuring your choice of cities and asked for the Los Angeles version of the shirt, but they sent the generic, non-city version. After I took the time to contact Daniel Fitzgerald, they sent the right shirt.6) More recently in the summer of 2023, I received a notification that my Small Axe order for the Customizable 4-Hot Sauces Gift Set Plus Free Mystery Hot Sauce had shipped, but when I checked further after a long delay, the package had never shipped at all based on the tracking number. So I reached back out to Daniel Fitzgerald and asked that they actually ship the package. Weeks later, the package finally arrived, but I discovered I was shorted one bottle of Habanero Ginger Hot Sauce that I had paid for when I checked the order against the emailed confirmation receipt. So I had to spend more time reaching out to Daniel again, who by now was the CEO of Small Axe Peppers, and asked if they could either ship the missing bottle or refund payment for the missing item.  I also enclosed photos showing that the bottle was missing on delivery for verification and followed up with a voice mail to Daniel. This time, I received the following note directly from him -- reprinted below without changing a word -- essentially firing me as a customer, despite many years of hanging in there with them through multiple issues, problems and misfires:I’ve refunded you 9 dollars for the missing bottle. I encourage you to order from Amazon moving forward or even another hot sauce company that might better suit your needs and expectations. Thanks DanWould you order from a company that consistently tries to evade responsibility for its product-fulfillment and data-security issues, and instead tries to push blame on the customer for being persistent with what is always time-consuming follow-up? It’s completely up to you, Fellow Amazon Buyer, but it’s best to proceed with caution and keep all email confirmations when you order anything – directly or through Amazon -- from Small Axe Peppers. Also, be on the lookout for any phantom Small Axe Peppers orders using your email address that you never actually placed, although that internal issue may have been (hopefully) resolved.",negative
"Price here seems to be as good as I've been able to find.  As for the taste: I usually have some lo-cal topping on it, so I don't notice it; the texture is Very crunchy/crispy, which I happen to like. I find them very filling which is helpful.",positive
A little pricey..$13 for 5 soups. But man..freakin delicious. I’d order this again and again. Added 2 slices of american white cheese and dropped and egg into the pot just before it was done boiling. AMAZING 👌🏼,positive

I have really enjoyed this product.,positive
"Shortly after the case of these arrived, I had to institute a rule that no one could eat more than 3 of these in one day.  They are delicious and convenient.  I keep some in the car for food emergencies, and the kids grab them for snacks and to help pack their lunches.  I prefer them to the Mott's type containers because we don't need spoons any more, and I've never seen apple-banana in Motts anyway.  Very glad I ordered these.",positive

This tea is really great tasty (for bagged tea) but it's hard to find in the US.  Amazon and Home Goods are the only places I've ever found it in the states.,positive
Use in keto baking. Is a good substitute,positive
Very few shrimp.  Overwhelming amount of red peppers.  Can only taste the peppers.,negative
I can give this crap no stars.  ABSOLUTELY NOT ONE STAR.  CRAP.  THANKS FOR RIPPING ME OFF! .  IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH? !,negative
It’s just a nasty tea.,negative
I love the Cherry Limeaid for its kick....but this order today is flat. Very obvious that Amazon has a abundance in the warehouse and the product had been sitting for too long.  The actual original flavor does not last while stored in the warehouse.  I decided to give it one more try....the last time lemon line was flat...so I'm not order I from Amazon anymore....this time the Cherry Limeaid is flat.  If Amazon cannot improve I will just take my chances at the store.  So disappointing!!!,negative
This tea is a GREAT!!!! It keeps my bowels going. I take it in the evening and the next morning I'm eliminating.,positive
We all love the hot chocolate!! Especially on cold days!!,positive
Years ago I tried instant coffee and hated it. Recently I decided to try instant for times when I only wanted a single cup so I purchaced some of these. I was shocked at how great it taste so much so I bought an electric kettle and switched to instant coffee altogether. This is a great product.,positive
"dollar wise it is cheaper than a large case. i love the stuff, in moderation.",positive
Excellent maple syrup!,positive
Very cute addition to my kids lunch boxes!,positive
I personally did not see this gift. However the faces of the delighted Grandchildren that received the Valentine Basket were thrilled. And was happy on the speedy delivery.  It was worth the price.,positive
My child and I don’t get enough fiber. This is 5yr old approved. He loves them. I have tried so many fiber bars and cookies for this kid amd all a fail. These brownies are so good. He thinks he is getting a treat but nope fiber kiddo. I do Noom amd this brownie fits right in for the day. Love that it is low in calories,positive
My son goes through graham crackers like they’re going out of style. This was an amazing deal compared to the grocery store!,positive
Sets up good. Yummy yogurt:),positive
I ordered this because it looked full and so beautiful. What I got was a flat package with hardly anything in it and had to give it to good friends as I had no time to get anything else. I was truly embarrassed. I ordered 4 and they all came the same way. You should be truly embarrassed to ship an almost empty basket when your picture shows something so beautiful and full.,negative
"We are a plant-based family, so we consume a lot of legumes. Undoubtedly, chickpeas are our favourite. These are very good. I love that they come in a convenient one pound package, at the bulk price. It's no fun lugging a 10 or 25lbs bag of peas to prep for dinner.",positive
"It's by far the best tasting protein drink I've ever had. They describe it as a protein milkshake which I actually think is totally accurate. The price seems sort of nuts because the bottles have 42g protein. If you break it down by cost per gram of protein though, it's about 8 cents which is very comparable to any of your leading protein powders that cost $1.50 to $2 per serving of ~20g of protein. So yeah, per drink it's pricey but not for the protein you get it. Even if it was extra pricey though, it's super worth it. It's so, so good. The chocolate is amazing. The vanilla is very solid (not as good as Choc though). Haven't had the strawberry.",positive
Fantastic product at a great price! Arrived in under two days. Support your local mushroom growers!,positive
How am I just learning about Vanilla Bean Paste now?!!!  I used this to make my almond milk this morning and it is so good!  It is not really a paste but more of a thick syrup with vanilla bean specks in it.  It blends in very smoothly and imparts a very good vanilla flavor without using a ton!  Vanilla extract is alcohol based and often leaves a hint of alcohol in fresh preparations like almond milk ... vanilla bean paste on the other hand does not and has a much stronger vanilla flavor .. YUMMMMM,positive
Got twice the amt at what I normally buy at the same price,positive
The candy came all sticky on the outside. And some pieces all stuck together.,negative
These Keto beef sticks are absolutely delicious. I will be ordering these again!,positive
"I am so happy to finally find a seasoning that the whole family loves. It is more than a rub, I sprinkle it on vegetable as they saute. Chicken, pork, it goes with everything. Don't be afraid of garlic in the name, it is very mild and not over powering.",positive
Shared the delicious chocolate candy with friends,positive
giv ya mom n gman happy mothers day,positive
"It is a shame Trader Joe's considers this mix a 'seasonal' mix and do not have it in their stores!It is the best gingerbread mix I have ever made and it is more than Delicious--it is AMAZINGLY STUPID TO MAKE AND YOU TAKE THE BOWS FOR IT!!I hope what I ordered is not expired food date--I plan to freeze the mixes and use them for special occasions.This should be a year round product, Trader Joe's! Shame on you!I know the seller is making a fortune selling these mixes, but they are worth the price.Ellen George, author and reviewer",positive
Taste DELICIOUS!!  Price is flat out horrible!!  That's over $5 a bottle!  Go to the store.  Save your money!.smh crazy,negative
"Taste great dip them in my tea in the morning.excellent biscottis,highly recommend",positive
Works great in smoothies. No more peanut butter spoons!,positive
"I sent this to my son and he informed me that some of the products were moldy.  So instead of taking any chances, he threw it out.  Waste of $ and disappointed.",negative
"This is the best honey ive tasted thus far, my wife is not that big on honey and she even said that it was some good stuff. Would recomind to all. Will be buying more soon for a batch of MEAD:)  oh ya,  no issues with packing and was delivered on time.",positive
"Great flavor, I love adding a shot of this to my brew",positive
I put this stuff on everything. It is SO tasty. I need to buy it in a 2 pack because I go through it so quickly. I can't imagine anybody not loving this product.,positive
Always purchase these when they have little sale on them. I didn't usually drink soarkling water but perrier changed me. This lime flavor has little zing in it at the end. Some people might not like it but I was okay with this one.,positive
"Glad I ordered 2 containers so I got to sample and enjoy the product. Package was delivered/and left on the ground at my front gate. Upon txt mssg receipt of delivery I retrieved package immediately. Outer carton was soaked through wet. (see pics). Inner carton was soaking wet and had been opened and resealed. Upon opening inner carton I discovered one container smashed/broken and shrink wrapped. Contents of the smashed container with no brine liquid in it due to total empty out leakage and many of the pickles from that container obliterated. The resulting overall rating of 1 star is the sole responsibility of the shipping vendor and if there was a no star rating available I would've selected it, & a shame too because the pickles are outstanding !!!!",negative
"This is the main rice one will find for risotto in stores in El Paso, Texas, not sure about other cities. My conclusion is that arborio is really easy to over cook and even when cooked correctly the grains absorb all of the liquid so that they adhere together and the texture is a bit chalky. Although it tastes fine, texture has a big impact in how we perceive how something taste which is why beef tenderloin is so sought compared to chuck. In my opinion a rice like carnaroli is much more suited to risotto although this rice might be fantastic rice pudding.",negative
"I've never seen a more under filled can - after draining the liquid it is less than half full.  Mussels taste fine, but poor value for the quantity of meat.",negative
"Love the flavor and smoothness!  Taste great with ice cream ,, but also with fruit.",positive
I received everything shown in the picture/ description.,positive
"Modifying my once 5-star rating.  Pretty much my only requirement of a coffee is that it not explode upward into my machine, wasting the cup and requiring 20 minutes of intense cleaning before I can even use it again without getting grounds.  Guess which requirement these have failed to meet three times now from my current batch?No other complaints, I'm enjoying a cup right now as I type this, but in need of some quality control.",negative
"That's all I have to say. Love, love, love it.",positive
"I was expecting a different taste, they are hard and we did not love the flavor or the after taste",negative
Tastes vaguely like some sort of mint but not peppermint and definitely doesn't taste like Mocha. I tried it three different ways and ended up just dumping the entire thing,negative
Go great with mustard oil,positive
A large protein cookie that’s soft and tasty. Great for on the go or as a snack.,positive
"Too salty.  Even after I stored them in a container of fresh water, olive oil and garlic, these are still salty b@!!&!",negative
"This is the best stuff I have ever put in my mouth!!!! No longer available here in the US (if it's good, it's discontinued) it is costly, but worth every penny. Quick easy meal; sauce performs miracles on the flavor of chicken; taste is nuanced, light. Don't be put off by the white wine -can't even taste it. Packaging of product is not as shown. I have 14 bottles in my pantry, just in case!",positive
"I am totally disappointed with the trail mix I received.  In fact, it gave me an allergy, causingme to give the majority of the package away.  I have eaten trail mix for over a year with noproblems.  It has a May 11, 2015 ""best before"" date, causing me to consider that some ofthe mix was possibly outdated!""",negative
"This stuff is delicious!  Larger bottles than you can buy at the local grocery for a much better price (at least when I bought it).  Taste is similar to nacho cheese Doritos, but a little less tangy.  My son turned me on to it, and I’m glad he did!",positive
I love this tea!  I will DEFINITELY reorder.  😎,positive
I dislike this jar of cashews. There are a bunch of rotten peanuts in this container,negative
"Delicious! Sweet, a little tangy yet there's a little kick of spice to it. Even if you have very low tolerance, you will love this because the spice is not overpowering at all. I got this on a whim, and decided to make stir fry tofu and ground turkey over rice, and it was amazing. As one review said, a little goes a long way and I still have more than half the bottle left to make more things with. Will definitely buy again!",positive
"Like a Chicken Top Ramen only with a more complex, well balanced, garlic driven, light Tonkotsu broth. Earned a permanent seat in the ramen drawer fo sho.",positive
They liked it,positive
"I'm glad I bought a single to try. I had hoped to have a cup of broth for something different versus my Tea. I heated it up, but can't get passed the smell and taste.Others suggested on pouring over dog food, to not just waste it.....my dog wouldn't even touch it.",negative
This is amazing!! I have been wanting to try Pork King Good products for a while. Finally did and it was as amazing as I imagined. I made pork rind “breaded” chicken and my boyfriend loved it so much he literally liked the plate. Perfect substitute since he is diabetic. Definitely going to try other flavors and recipes with these.,positive
"I wish there were some decently priced large bags of these chips, but I'll settle for 60 tiny bags. These are delicious. A fair amount of heat, but with a really sweet kicker. Easily my favorite bbq chip.I'd been searching for a tasty spicy chip or snack (the runner up is probably Hot & Spicy Chex Mix, but with those it's delicious chex mixed with a bunch of stuff that often winds up in the trash), and these Red Hot Riplets are simply fantastic.",positive
"I am a fiend for salt and vinegar potato chips, I always have been since I was a young kid.I have diabetes now and need to be more careful and smart with my snack choices. I bought these blue diamond salt and vinegar almonds with low expectations and was just trying to find a decent edible alternative.I will never eat another salt and vinegar chip again! These things are absolutely amazing! I cannot believe how great the flavor of them is. They generously coat them in the flavor- be warned, they are super zingy and tangy with gobs of vinegar flavor on every almond, but I like the aggressive flavoring like that.If you like salt and vinegar snacks- give these things a try. They are amazing!",positive
"These candies are the BEST and they are VERY hard to find! Thank you for carrying them, Amazon. :)",positive
"The only true description of this item is the ""baby"" part.  These ribs must have come from a newborn pig - they are the tiniest I've EVER seen.  They're still sitting in my freezer waiting for when I need a toothpick with some meat on it.Total and complete waste of money.  Unbelievable.",negative
My family has really enjoyed Smartfruit. We mix it with ice in the blender and it is a great refreshing snack for the entire family. This is my second reorder and we are looking forward to trying all the different flavors.,positive
Stale and nasty.,negative
Omg what can I say except GREAT PRODUCT,positive
This popcorn tastes so much better than regular popcorn,positive
"It stays crunchy, has a good chocolate flavor, and keeps you in your macros. This is a keto lifesaver. My cheats were centered around the late night bowl of cereal so this is a godsend.",positive
"I love this product, I have lost 15 lbs in 1 month. It makes you feel full and after awhile you literally don’t want to eat food, you crave the shake. I make a full blender full, so I drink a good amount in the morning then late afternoon. Sometimes I sip on it throughout the day. I add frozen bananas and some organic berries along with almond milk as well as the Naked green machine drink. Tastes amazing.",positive
Maybe I didn't pay attention to the size but the bag is super tiny for the price. Not worth it at all. Very dissatisfied.,negative
"Very good product. Use all the time. However, in the last shipment one box was damaged and unable to use. Shipping cartons for this item need to be stronger.",positive
"this was more of a lighter / sour breakfast blend. I typically drink medium-to-dark roasts, and this roast doesn't fit that category despite stating that it's' medium.",negative
Will save you a trip to olive garden if you're like me and go there mainly for the salad. Taste EXACTLY like the salad dressing they have at the restaurant.,positive
"I stepped it for hours over the warmer on the stove and it doesn’t release a good flavor, it does have a bitter taste thought, was very disappointing",negative
I love having water delivered but I hate the huge box. I wish they would deliver without the box.,positive
Love this Seaweed,positive
"I tried Postum, but it’s hard to get it to dissolve in hot water. Pero dissolves well and has a pleasant taste.",positive
This is the first tahini I've purchased where I didn't have to stir forever to get that smooth consistency. It's tasty! I like mine on toasted sprouted bread. I will definitely be reordering from this company.,positive
I am a huge chicken wing fan and these chicken wings are by far the most delicious. I can't go back to eating Perude or Dyson wings. I hope the amazon truck has these in stock more often.,positive
I don’t think this was the real Cameron’s it tasted like water I think it was counterfeit,negative
In a world that changes constantly it is great that these caramels are as good now as they were when I ate them in my school days.,positive
great way to make garlic butter to put on my steak before I sever them,positive

"Expensive, but if you wanna run through a wall or match a toddlers intensity. Try it.",positive
"This was my first time ordering these, and they are really good.  You can taste the freshness with each crunch!",positive
First time this happened and awful . I will ask for refund for broken jar and unusable contents,negative
"I am very impressed with this premium organic coffee. This coffee is uniquely delicious and has a great smell and flavor. I have enjoyed this high-quality coffee more than some of the other brands that I have used, and I will continue to purchase this coffee. I highly recommend this smooth and flavorful coffee and would encourage others to try it.",positive
"Way to sweet... Not sure how so many people left these great reviews, which i relied on when buying a product.",negative
These are better than the Bob's brand.  You can freeze them or just use them as shooters.  I use them for leg cramps.,positive
We love this coffee and will be buying from now on!,positive
"[[VIDEOID:8dafe1dea600e2e0e230c96c44375b56]] Pro: Very versatile, can use it in anything. good flavor and texture. feels light like skim or 1% milk. has a vanilla flavor but it is not too strong. Just the right level of sweetness.Cons: If you are sensitive to artificial sweetener this is not for you.",positive
"I grew up in New Mexico and it’s hard to find good, authentic green chile flavor outside the state. This is the best I’ve had!",positive
Repeat customer.  Great products.,positive
"the rice is great and it's a good price but it def came all over the amazon box and then to my floor. The bag was broken and they knew it was broken and still sent it, because some tape was over the hole?? like what the heck? but regardless of losing a quarter of my rice, the rice was good quality lol",negative
These are the worst gummies I've ever had in my life I ate them as soon as I got them and all day I've been throwing up  and My ass has been a waterfall all day  I've been on the toilet for 4 hours today,negative
"Love, love, love this granola! The Viki's brand is doing a great job at being mostly healthy and great tasting. I love to throw this on my plain Greek yogurt in the morning.",positive
"I’m watching my sugar and carbs and this stuff is great! It’s packed with protein and great for a keto diet. It’s great for snacking as is but my main “go to” is to add it to a low carb, sugar free Greek yogurt and it’s become my favorite daily snack. It’s super filling as well. It’s a little pricey but most (if not all) the ingredients are organic so I fit it into my budget because it’s good for me and I like it. I can’t wait to try the other flavors!",positive
Love this delicious treat. So sad Costco no longer carries it. Looking for a new way to get some.,positive
Great stuff but I don't think my doctor would approve.,positive
"True Country Ham at its BEST!!!  Thanks, we really enjoyed this ham, it arrived ahead of time, well packaged with complete cooking instructions, and even ""how to carve"" on the back of the holiday sack it arrived in.  I would highly recommend this ham to anyone looking for an old fashioned smoke house ham.  Super deal for the price - a solid whole ham, no injected water, etc., dry cured.  The aroma while baking  and then the taste - amazing!!",positive
"Really nice cup of tea!  Smells great in my bath teas and sachets too. Nice rich color, not dull or dry looking. Smells fresh. I will order this again.",positive
"Must admit the idea of ordering seafood from Amazon sounded a bit sketchy. But I took a chance, and for the price, convenience, and quality, these scallops are a fine offering. No tinny taste. They thaw quickly in a bowl of water. The ultimate convenience protein.",positive
"My favorite hot sauce. And I don't really care for hot sauces because they are always too vinegary and it masks the flavor of the chile. De La Viuda is a perfect balance of chiles and tartness of the vinegar. I can actually taste the wonderful flavor of the hatch chiles. I put it on fried eggs, quesadillas, any kind of taco, tamales, pizza and especially spaghetti sauce. The vinegar from De La Viuda really brightens spaghetti sauces or any tomato based sauces. Definitely, a keeper",positive
"Awesome! Great in cocktails.Syrup is delicious in its own right too, heat in saucepan and pour over ice cream!!",positive
The product was fresh,positive
"Loved, loved, loved it.Bought some at a resent visit to DisneyWorld in Orlando and had to have more when I returned home.It is DIVINE!",positive

Came in individual bags vs one bulk bag. Delicious and fresh!,positive
"I didn't expect the teas to smell and taste so wonderful, it exceeded my expectations.",positive
Great product and customer service!  Will be buying again!,positive
"These dark chocolate covered apricots were delicious. They arrived on time in excellent condition. They are excellent for a commercial product.I especially liked that they were individually wrapped, keeping them fresh and preventing them from becoming sticky altogether; that also keeps them fresh for much longer and that they will keep for however slowly you want to consume them. They are very well priced so they are a great treat that I can afford to have even on a daily basis.  I highly recommend them so I give them 5 stars.",positive
Perfect purple color. Came quickly .,positive
Very good flavor and works great in the K-cup brewer.,positive
"Not sure what these are, but they're NOT the ""good"" Twizzlers. Kinda mushy and don't taste right ~",negative
"I love this stuff! I put it in a pepper shaker and have been putting it on everything... my wife is seriously not into spicy food so it's a great way to kick things up a notch without just putting hot sauce all over everything, which I've learned is an insult to the chef (particularly if you haven't even tried it yet). This accomplishes the same goal but flies under the radar. Win-win!I also had a little beer salt container that I emptied out and filled with this stuff. I take that to restaurants and other places.It's great on popcorn with a little salt, but you really do have to be careful rubbing your eyes (etc) afterwards!",positive
I sent this bouquet to my mother in law so embarrassed by what she received,negative
Zing to scrambled eggs & cheese without the mess of frying bacon. Pretty good!,positive
Didn't taste it. Used to keep mice out of car. Don't know how well it works yet...,positive

"this has opened us up to many more things to try!!! and it arrived promptly, even days befroe it was originally sacheduled to arrive. I heartily recommend this seller to everyone!!",positive
Love this tea. I take many prescription medications and I believe this helps keep me from becoming toxic. I have used it for over a year and I can tell if I don't drink it. Good stuff :),positive
"Not good, had to bin this stuff.",negative
"Came fast, perfect condition and easy to use! We had s very happy 11 year old. Thanks",positive
"They arrive yesterday morning and I've used four spices in three  meals.  The spices are FRESH, brilliant flavoring and leave you wanting more bits.  For example  Friday I used the ""Ras El Handout"" spice for a sauted salsa mix.  Wonderous!  It was meant to be a sidedish, but even took over the kabbobs.  Flavor came across as a fancy turmeric cousin with many deep and rich  under tones of other spices.  Even gentle palates loved the dish.  For lunch we had four cheese mac with 'chili' topping.  Used the Harissa spice blended and heated into  very fine crumbs.  Delicious.  Great House warming gift, although I'd add an small olive oil.  These samples are small, enough for one or two dishes.  I got them for myself to celebrate 2022 and add some new international dishes since it's not looking like I'll get there.  I'm considering buying the other Spicewalla Sampler.  Quality from this company is terrific.",positive
"ya cant send this directly to the intended recipient and think it will be assembled, cuz it wont. Gift receiver has to put it together, no rocks or stones included :(",negative
My absolute favorite flavor now! No need for sugar or creamer it is perfection!,positive
For the price this is the best deal. I make Duck Confit with it and it is so flavorful.,positive
Delicious Matcha - won’t need to go to The Buck anymore to pick up one cause I can make at home!,positive
Amazon pack this with ice! Impressive... and delicious,positive
Good price for kcups with good taste,positive
Wow! Best jerky I have ever had!  Thank you!,positive
"We use this in our bounce house and concession rental company and they are fantastic. I've never found anything better and believe me i've looked.The price is around $.91 a piece and you just don't get pre-portioned packs any cheaper than that. The flavoring is robust and it's so simple, you just slice the top off and dump everything into the kettle (We rent an actual commercial popcorn machine).Another great thing is the smell. It smells up the house almost EXACTLY like a movie theater. The smell is sometimes better than the actual popcorn! Bottom line, you won't be disappointed in this.",positive
"The chocolate was poor quality, And all the chocolates fell to the bottom. Disappointing all around",negative
Add a splash of this to lime rickeys or to a gin and tonic for a little zing that is tasty and good... it is also good to add to any soda you might add lime such as a coke or sprite...,positive
Which more came in the package for the money,positive
"I bought this Go Bacon for my husband who is away overseas and totally missing out on things from home, like the joys of bacon! When I came across this I thought this would make a perfect addition to a care package. When he received his box, it was the first thing he opened and said ""I need more, it tasted so good. You have no idea how much I've missed the taste of bacon"". So that said, I'd say this is pretty spot on from a homesick bacon loving guys point of view. I'll definitely be filling care packages with the GoBacon.",positive
"This curry power is the real thing! After watching a Krimi on PBS where the guys hit a Bratwurst stand after work, I needed a real Curry Wurst. Well you need three things - real Bratwurst (white in color - ALDI), good curry and Hela Curry Ketchup! Brown Bratwurst, cut in pieces, sprinkle with curry and top with Ketchup! A slice of white bread is optional. Tastes just like home (Germany)!",positive
So much candy!!!!!! Great deal.,positive
Would you expect anything less from Illy? Came packaged well and tastes great.,positive
"I was really looking forward to opening up the bag and taking a great big inhale of aromatic earl grey tea.  Instead, I experienced a mildly unpleasant smokiness that made me cringe.  I tried a cup just to see if it would taste better than it smelled and was disappointed at its bitter smokey flavor. It's not horrible, but not delicious either.",negative
"Everyone is so worried about eating the right food, that they let that cloud their common sense. I am over 50 and in great health and no gut, and I eat whatever I want, when I want. Always have. Cookie Crisp is a fun cereal to eat (love chocolate chip cookies), and it is healthy as well.",positive
This whole chicken was perfect size for my family I cleaned it and it was right size for my air fryer,positive
Very Good Flavour,positive
I never liked oatmeal or any hot cereal before trying this product.  It has made me a lover of oatmeal.  I would love to be able to purchase this in case form to save money though.,positive
Love it! No gmo!,positive
This is the first time I got any spice online and I must say that the quality and freshness is very impressive. It has the freshness and flavor you want in an authentic spice. Aleppo pepper gets that taste.,positive
"We have ordered the wine gums from Gustaf's many time, and have always been happy with them. We normally love them. The ones that we got this time aren't the same colors and really do not taste good. The wine gums have always been my husbands favorites. Sadly, we will never order them again.",negative
"Great quality coconut oil. I don't use it for cooking but I use it for just about everything else. I put a tablespoon in my coffee to help burn belly fat (this really works when used in conjunction with exercise and a healthy diet of course). I use it as a toothpaste, a moisturizer, diaper rash cream. It's fabulous.This brand in particular has nice mild coconutty flavor and I love that the jar has a wide mouth and is easy to scoop out the oil. The jar is plastic however which is my only issue with it but I will continue to order it.",positive
I love these but do read the ingredients.,positive
"I like the Spanish feels very much oh, I just wish they were little more inexpensive.",positive
Amazon ask what I used this product for--seriously. It's coffee!,positive
This is Organic. One of the few Organic breakfast cereals on the market. Stops the kids from getting poisoned at breakfast from the people selling sprayed and grown in poisons cereals on the market now.,positive

Pros:- Nice flavor.- Good for traveling.Cons:- Expensive.- Presentation is too small for the price.,positive
Moved away from carbonated beverages so trying different ice teas.  This has become one of my favorites.  Great flavor.  Refreshing!,positive
"A product imported from Spain, this product has a marvelous taste- sweet, but not too sweet. It is a superior product well worth the money. If you've never tried it, you can always buy 1 or 2 boxes, but  the majority of people, will be pleasantly surprised by it's rich taste & its crunchy texture. We have been eating it for several years, & my wife would not be without it.",positive
"Country Kitchen Frankfurter Rolls. Mass produced readily available nothing special overpriced. Perhaps I was naive but for the price I was expecting a much higher quality product instead I got what I was hoping to avoid, plain white bread rolls with dough conditioners and preservatives. If I had known what I was going to receive I would not have ordered it.",negative
Use them mostly for a cream based substitute.  Highly recommended.,positive
I'm all about sugar free stuff. This is my favorite gum.,positive
Perfect size for an 8” round cake!! So cute!!!,positive
"This crispy, flavorful sauerkraut is one of the two best raw sauerkrauts that I’ve ever tasted — the other being Superkrauts Healing Kraut. Both are tasty and organic, and mercifully without the excessively overbearing salty taste that plagues many brands of sauerkraut.",positive
very delicious!!,positive
"This coffee is surprisingly good for a Mcdonalds brand. I find myself always reaching in the box and realizing there is no more. There isn't much complexity but the taste is amazing. The flavors are simple and clean coffee, there is no bitterness and or artificial flavorings like some of the other brands out there.This makes this coffee very pleasant and drinkable. With some coffee, the complexity can make it boring to drink after a while but this is a very balanced coffee, which makes it good.",positive
For drinking it self and mix with fruit in the blender,positive
This was a first time buy for me.  They were easy to use and were beautiful. The ladies couldn't believe the butterflies were edible.  They were a hit.,positive
"To start, my review is based off a bag I got from TJMaxx.I don’t know about you, but I have no impulse control when it comes to spicy foods. Unless I start getting a stomachache and have snot coming out of my nose, it’s not spicy enough. These checked off all the boxes. Stomachache after about 15 chips? Check. Water coming out of my nose? Check. Puked the following day from eating half of a regular sized bag in one sitting? Check. If you’re looking for something truly spicy, these are where it’s at. And yes, I did indeed vomit from eating too many of these. Will that stop me from buying more? Nope! Bring on the heat!",positive

"These dried roses smell so divine, especially if you love roses. The roses are great for multiple uses like baths & skincare & food.I have been using them in my baths and my facial mists.It is safe to use since the roses are vegan and don’t have preservatives.The good thing is that the roses come in another bag instead of the roses just being in the brown bag and if it ripped the petals will be flying all over the place. I would put the rose petals in a zip lock bag to prevent fall out & to preserve the freshness of the rose petals.",positive
This was wonderful purchase! Great quality!,positive
"We are enjoying the freezer pops!!!  Since I am cutting calories and sweets, whenever I am craving for something flavorful, I grab a freezer pop.",positive
I love these! Couldn’t put them down!,positive
"Way too salty and just not good imo. Saw it on shark tank and thought that it sounded good and should try it, but way way too salty and sadly just not good at all.",negative
"Did not get a chance to try but about 25% I salvaged if that. Went bad in the fridge. If you can buy and use fresh, it’s a good purchase. Not good for those who need to keep for more than a day or two.",negative

"Tastes like real peanuts, nice mix of actual nuts, a little oily but OK for me.",positive
I like Peatos products. Best before date states Aug 22. I don't get why they taste so stale? I won't return them because I opened 2 bags. These are costly to purchase and just throw away. Disappointed 😞,negative
It's a scam. Do not buy.,negative
Price gouging much?  I’ve been buying this for over a year for $1.63-$1.74 a carton. And now it’s 7.18. I’d like to know why. I’ve really enjoyed it but won’t order this again. You’ve lost me as a customer.,negative
I use this to bake bread as a substitution for butter. Bread tastes better and is much healthier.,positive
Love them. Wish they were here in the US and not so expensive to get.,positive
My favorite tea. I drink it every morning.  Perfect blend.  ❤,positive
"Yes, this is a great product that stays fresh and taste good. We are new coconut oil people as far as eating the product.  We select this brand most of the time.",positive
"They come in pineapple?! These are soooo delicious. If you like Hi-Chews and/or pineapple, these are amazing.",positive
"You can only eat so many pork rinds and parmesan crisps so these really came in clutch to satisfy my snacking needs! I've previously tried another brand of keto chips and they were absolutely disgusting so I was worried about these but they are very good! They do not taste exactly like Doritos, of course, but they are a very satisfying replacement for those doing keto.",positive
"Majority were crushed when delivered.  I like the product, but the how they were delivered gets the 1 star.",negative
I just really don't like the flavor.  I tried.,negative
I love this brand of chocolate for my business I just wish they filled the bad more I’m paying like $20 for half the bag 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ I couldn’t find any in stores usually ($7-8) so I had to come on here and get it and it’s perfect just a little overpriced is all,positive
Muy bueno 👍,positive
Normally they are delicious but they were dry and hard like they had been left in the freezer too long,negative
"I too have tried to mix my own GFCFSF flour and it never comes out as good as this one.  I have used Bob's Red Mill for making cookies, muffins, breading for chicken nuggets and breads.  The only time it didn't work out for me was for making pancakes.  The bean smell and taste was overpowering in the pancakes.  But for everything else, no one could really tell that my baked goods were GFCFSF.",positive
They make flavorful iced tea.,positive
The recipient liked the gift,positive
"Finished the whole bag in 2 days.  Ashamed of myself, but delicious",positive
It's addicting! Pricey but great for a special treat or gift.,positive
Love this cold brew! Comes as a subscription monthly and is always fresh and yummy!,positive
"These cookies are delicious but I don't enjoy eating broken ones.  I ordered 6 packages and did eat one despite all the crumbles.  But lo and behold, they are all broken up.  I am not at all happy.",negative
"This is probably the last of this. Very disappointed that my grandchildren will no longer have pastina and me for that matter. Yes it was pricey, my grandchild just started eating food, he had to have it.I’m hoping it makes a comeback like twinkies did",positive

"Best tuna ever. Expensive, but so good.",positive
It came broken 💔,negative
Have to stir it. But taste great.,positive
The taste is somewhat like I remember it and I will most likely order again.,positive
These are amazing. They are the only energy drink that actually wakes me up in the morning and I can’t seem to find them in the grocery store. I used to have Diet Coke or a coffee but I became immune to both so these have become a lifesaver!,positive
"Used for cleaning recipes, works fantastic! Great value",positive
"Flavor is excellent, melts with ease. I have been making chocolate for 35 years. I've tried other brands when I couldn't find Merckens-none of the others compare-Merckens is the BEST!!",positive
"Probably my fault for not researching more.  When I opened an individual packet I was surprised how little product was in the bag.  On the back of the packet it clearly states ""Each bag contains approximately 1/2 cup of mango.""  Imagine how many pieces of popcorn you would get in 1/2 cup.  I will say the taste of the product was very good. I could have eaten 10 bags. My greatest dissatisfaction, though, came when I discovered on the bag that the product came from China.  This the country that puts poison in its dog food and baby food.  I was a bit freaked out after that.",negative
This vinegar is well worth the money. It worked perfectly in my recipe and I was very happy with it.,positive
"These burn really fast. What should last 8-10 hours in my AMNPS only lasts 3-4. Tried to reach out to the company for advice, but got no response.",negative
This chili seasoning is the closest thing I've found to my Mom's homemade Texas Chili recipe. I have to order it online as it's not available in stores near me.,positive
I've bought this risotto for many years. It is very easy to prepare and so delicious. Glad to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price.,positive
Everyone loves these.....the cinnamon flavor is so strong!!,positive
It’s actually a little sweet tasting. The bitterness comes from paying almost triple what Earth Fare charges. Check your local market before paying this high a price.,negative
Too much onion was overpowering,negative
Candy had been heated and smashed leaving product in questionable looking state.,negative
I prefer medium blend coffee‘s. I first start using this ground in s can. Still love it and always will!!,positive
"I love most of Claey's hard candy products with only a couple of exceptions - The Wild Cherry reminds me off the old cherry cough syrup Mom gave us when we were kids - brrr, shudder, and the Clove candies. As anyone who has used cloves in cooking knows, a very little bit goes a very long way.When I popped a couple of these candies in my mouth the overwhelming, bitter, dried clove taste was not good. My nose and eyes burned and there was a lingering ""dusty"" aftertaste. Nothing was good about the experience. Now I am stuck with a 2 pound bag (I was that certain I would like them given the light touch Claey's has with lemon, anise, and other flavors) and not sure what to do with it.No one in our house wants them, so we'll have to figure something out. It's too bad too because Claeys offers many high quality candies in tough to find flavors. In this case my taste buds felt under attack and rebelled.",negative
Perfect for those Pinterest recipes.,positive
They arrived very quickly and have great flavor,positive
"Don't hesitate, buy it! It's sweet and delicious and low gylcemic so it's a great substitute for other refined sugars. Bonus points for not only a great product, but also a great woman-owned small business that supports diabetes research. So far, I've used it to bake brownies and they came out delicious!",positive
"Great novelty. In my opinion it doesn't taste or smell that great, but it is VERY hot as it should be. In my opinion it's actually hotter than the 357 gold edition. One drop of this sent my mouth into a lava burning sensation and tears forming. Two drops sent my friends nose bleeding and him running for the milk.",positive
Multiple cans with large dents- I ordered two cases. Came in two boxes. Dented cans on both.,negative
"Love this natural sweetener - tastes like a cross between dark maple syrup, agave, and molasses. It is versatile and mild when used in cooking, just the sweetness is expressed, without a whole lot of identifiable flavour.",positive
"I don't know what ""real"" Haggis is supposed to taste like, but I enjoyed this.  At least this version doesn't really remind me of meat - more like a dip, that would go well with crackers or toast.  I would buy it again, but at $14/can, that's not going to happen anytime soon.  Amazon also shipped my two cans in a padded envelope, so *obviously* the cans came very dented.",positive
Fresh. And work as advertised,positive
"I can't drink coffee but I love it and I miss it.  This is a very decent alternative, thank you!",positive

Looked great and tasted great!,positive
"I used this to make a simple pizza dough (flower/salt/water/yeast).  It mixed well and started fermenting right away. The dough had excellent texture, structure and, above all, flavor.  This is great stuff.  I'll order it again over using supermarket flour for pizza dough.",positive
"I have been searching for a replacement for our beloved Swee-Touch-Nee tea which is no longer available anywhere, and thought this might be it. Interesting, reading other unfavorable reviews, I think Taylor's of Harrowgate may be having some quality control issues. Some folks say this has no flavor at all, our problem is the opposite. Even after leaving the bags in the pot only a couple of minutes, the tea tastes strong and bitter, an effect that usually happens when tea is ""stewed"", or left to brew too long. Unfortunately, I bought the huge box, and am afraid it will just end up in the compost.",negative
"I love the bulk purchase. Makes packing lunch easy! The crisps are very tasty. Each single serving bag is 200 calories, and 8 grams of fat. So not the healthiest. But if you are eating healthy, you're probably not buying prepackaged foods. But if you like the convenience, this variety pack is for you :)",positive
Did not dissolve well in any liquids. Thank your,negative

"Not real orange. Purchased this item 6 times over the years and when you have house full of kids that cannot eat chocolate. THIS IS THE WORSE IT HAS EVER BEEN. Flavor, size and color are awful.",positive
I'm disappointed because my chips were delivered May 5th and the expiration dates are Mayv18th and June 1st. That's too soon.,negative
I love this product! Wish I could re-order but Amazon advises this product is no longer available and no date is given as to when it will be available.,positive
"Ever since the cinema-loving universe made acquaintance with a guy named George A. Romero, the word ""zombie"" automatically gets associated with blood-soaked horror images and non-stop acting sequences. It's safe to say that his ""Night of the Living Dead"" formed the zombie movie as we know it now. Yet, in the earliest years of cinema, the premise of reanimated corpses was merely used in slow, nearly action-less psychological thrillers. Jacques Tourneur's ""I walked with a Zombie"" is a perfect example and so is ""White Zombie"", starring Bela Lugosi. This ""Revolt of the Zombies"" could have been another example but unfortunately it's a failure over the entire line and easily one of the most tedious movies I ever saw. Dreadful acting, a very poorly written screenplay and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film only lasts 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is entirely wasted on stupid love-story intrigues and unexciting monologues. The setting in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor surely could have resulted in a more compelling story but all we ever see are interior shots. The lead actress (Dorothy Stone, textbook blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose) irritated me enormously and I kept hoping a ravenous undead would suddenly appear out of nowhere to devour her. Unlucky again. If you manage to struggle yourself through 60 soporific minutes, you'll be rewarded with a fairly decent finale. Still, this is far too little to give this film a positive rating, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! This is the type of movie you should only see in case you already saw everything else.",negative
Got these for my candy table at our baby shower and they were super yummy and a big hit on the table! Some gummy candy tastes funky but these did not disappoint!,positive
It’s really difficult to find a soup I like that my family or myself haven’t made. This one is very tasty. Enjoy,positive
I bought these cupcake toppers for my daugher’s graduation party. The toppers arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I recommend these for your event or party!,positive
"If I could leave a zero, I would!!!!! There’s nothing premium about this candy box...I mean bag. Gifted it for Christmas as I have in the past (Turkish box was very nice) but this one is a joke. I wouldn’t eat a single thing inside this plastic pouch",negative
"I have a bunch left, but am bummed that none of the local stores sell this product:(  But good sale!  Thanks!",positive
"We purchased this before from Amazon and loved it, so we purchased it again!  Everyone loves the original flavor!  The Hot and Spicy is a little hot for us, so since we use ground turkey that comes in a 2.5 pound container, we use one Hot and Spicy and one Original.  That makes the people who like the hot & spicy happy, but isn't too hot for us !  The Teriyaki is a little bland, like many people pointed out.  So, I throw a little extra liquid Teriyaki in there to help it along.  The Garlic & cracked pepper is really good too !!  We have a Nesco dehydrator and put it on for 8 hours, using the round tip on the jerky gun.  It comes out like a Slim Jim, but so much better for you - less fat, etc... Yes, I know there are chemicals in this too... We also use the dehydrator for fruits and herbs...  When we run out of this 24 pack, we will be reordering from Amazon !",positive
I wish we had something like this in the states. Such a unique snack.,positive
"This was a gift, recipient is pleased",positive
I prefer the less salt version.,positive
This sauce is great on anything I’ve tried.  We used to use sweet baby’s on everything. This is ten times better on every thing.,positive

"These are great to bring with some celery for my lunch at work. Very convenient. The packs tear open easily, but the foil is durable enough that it doesn't split open on its own.",positive
I have been buying these for my son since he was 9mths old.  I give him his Vitamin D drops on them and he loves to have them as snacks during the day.  They are low calorie and fun for them to eat.  My son likes to count his or stick them to his fingers and nose.  A great little fun food!  You can get them through Subscribe and Save too for a great discount!,positive
Does not come in the described container and therefore was not able to be kept,negative
really yummy and feel good using instead of refined sugar on oatmeal etc.... great flavor,positive
"I find these cups very tasty. They are, however, single-serve convenience packs, which undermines the “value for the money” category.",positive
Watery and bland. No flavor,negative
Mixed with the hollandaise sauce it works great 🙂,positive
These were gritty and disgusting. “Blue cheese” is mealie and little white bits float around the jar. Unappetizing to say the least 🤢,negative
packaged well - taste good,positive
"one of my favorite k-cup product. Very crisp, strong taste! i defenilty reccomend this product to new and old coffee lovers!",positive
"I'm a huge fan of Milano cookies -- all flavors of them.  The buttery-crisp wafers sandwiching a thin layer of dark chocolate -- what's not to like?These are nice because they're packaged in 4-cookie packs.  No, they're not terribly low-calorie (230 calories per pack), but at least this way I can't do *too* much damage!  I just toss a pack into my bag when I'm off for the day, and I have a nice tasty snack for later.Good stuff!",positive
This is EXACTLY like the bouillon cubes I used to buy when stationed in Italy.  I am thrilled beyond measure to be able to buy these here in the US!!!!!,positive
It dries out pretty quickly. Wonderful flavor.,positive
It said is a Cinnamos Gum and when qe received it it was Cinnamint.  I was looking for only Cinnamon Gum.,negative
Taste exactly how I remember them!,positive
Product same as pic..,positive
I use this for making my own dry convenience food mixes. I would recommend it to anyone who makes their own mixes.,positive
Tastes super refreshing with the hint of lemon but not sweet,positive
I love these Oreos. Too bad they only come once a year.,positive
Mathis product is great.  I had it with whole milk and the taste was not over powering.  It did not taste bitter and mixed well.  I tried with oat milk and it was delicious.  It had the right amount of sweetness while still maintaining that matcha goodness.  I’m going to try it with coconut milk and see how that pairs.  I did not blend or follow directions…I poured my milk and eyeballed the amount of matcha.  I stirred and drank and it was wonderful.  I’m new to Matcha and have tried other companies flavor and this is by far the best. Taste better than Starbucks and much cheaper so 💯 all the way,positive
Wasn't disappointed with the quality of these clams. I'm sold on this product. Only knock is the can had a slight dent but it didn't effect the contents. I'll be stocking my pantry with more.,positive

"Best lipstick ever. Will not come off, while eating or drinking.",positive
I nice robust breakfast tea that can be drunk anytime.,positive
It's the best vegan jerky out there,positive
I have been buying this product for years. It is always of excellent quality.,positive
Tinkyada pasta is the best gluten free pasta I have used. I have a tendency to get distracted while I'm cooking and this pasta can take overcooking without any problem. The taste and texture are like any wheat pasta. My husband can't tell the difference I've been using Tinkyada now for about eight years and it is just flat the best.,positive
I loved this form of honey. It was thicker and creamy and easy to spread on my toast. And taste so good. Loved it with butter too on my toast,positive
This is the best! Got it for my daughters. The tea leaves are so beautiful when they bloom. And the tea is super yummy. I would def recommend this as a gift,positive
These soba noodles are so easy and versatile. We use them for an Asian noodles salad.,positive
Delicioso me trae los mejores recuerdos de Colombia,positive
"At first, I hated this. I was very excited to try it. It was a very foreign taste that I was not used to. ( I am a Caucasian from New Hampshire) I had bought a 4-pack for roughly $13 and I figured that I might as well try it again later that day just to be sure. I don't know what I was thinking earlier because I fell in love with it on the second go. I ate the whole damn thing that night. I was just walking around my house trying to squeeze as much of this little baby out as I could while my wife watched in disbelief (she witnessed my initial disgust) She thought I was faking the enjoyment so I could get her to try some. (She didn't).I love the way it comes out of the tube. It provides enough resistance so you don't eat it all at once. In the end there is a secret glob under the cap.  If you haven't had this yet, please try it. Get the jumbo size.",positive
"The First picture is highly misleading. They are just printed on paper and glued to a stick, save money and do it at home.",negative
I ordered 5 of these for last minute Christmas gifts for family. Each responded with how much they loved the packaging and items. Will definitely order more in the future. Items arrived sooner than expected and they were all delivered to various places in Southern California. Great gift ideas and alternative to more expensive fruit baskets.,positive
Needs to have more inside the package for the price.,positive
"The best GF flour I have found.  GF flour is never""good"", but the one is very close and versatile.",positive
Oreos have always been one of my family's favorite cookies but we don't get them often because of all the sugar and other not so great ingredients. I decided to give these a try and I am so surprised! They honestly taste better than a real Oreo cookie but somehow have 0g of sugar in them. I wasn't sure if they'd be able to meet the mark on the crunch or creaminess but THEY ARE SO GOOD! Seriously give these a try if you haven't yet. I can't wait for my next order to arrive!,positive
We love these. Great for a first time try. Price is high on all this freeze dried candy though so don’t eat them all in one sitting,positive
Have as is or doctor it up with any protein or veggies you'd like to add.,positive
I bought this for my mother as a special treat. She absolutely loves it! She said you can't taste the champagne in the preserves. Instead what it does is enhance and heighten the taste of the strawberries. Well worth the money and a terrific product we'll definitely buy again!,positive
I buy this for my husband who has stomach issues and needs probiotics and is also lactose intolerant. He loves the taste and feels so much better after drinking it! I hope they continue to make it.,positive
"I can a lot pickles,  relish etc. I use a lot of mustard seed. I also bought poppy seed and celery seed. Very pleases with my purchase",positive
Have used this brand for years. Recently unable to find in several of my favorite grocery stores. Was excited to find on Amazon and so close to same price.,positive
Bring back the lite syrup.The zero-sugar syrup sucks.,positive
I received this product today and had it with crescent rolls this evening. Tasted like fresh peaches right off the tree.,positive
Love the real chocolate flavor.  We for the most part use the powder in chocolate shakes instead of a higher carb dessert.  So very satisfying.  If sweetener is used we use stevia drops.Definirely recommend.,positive
Excellent packaging idea,positive
Grossest coffee I've ever tasted.,negative
Freshest salmon I ever hadClean bright flavorCalled my friends to let them know what a great product!,positive
"After a few tastes, I immediately went to return these, and was devastated to learn I can’t return them!Many of them have shell pieces stuck to them still, they taste very bitter- not at all creamy like I’m used to cashews tasting, and my mouth feels uncomfortable and tastes unpleasant still.My kiddo always wakes up with a handful of cashews that I roast for them, but I am actually worried about feeding them these.I will be contacting the seller tomorrow in hopes of something happening. Otherwise, an utter waste of money.",negative
This is definitiley the best frozen mac n cheese I've ever had. It even tastes great out of the microwave.,positive

They were lovely,positive
Mustard is mild and addicting .  Brought some to an Octoberfest party and it vanished .  Difficult to find in stores .  Buy it at Amazon . They use bullet proof packaging .,positive
"Simplicity itself.  Add water, mix, let rise 5 minutes to an hour, roll, top and cook.  I have started par-baking the dough for 3-4 minutes and then taking it out before adding fixings and finishing as I like the crust well done, and a par-baked pie is easier to handle onto and off of a pizza stone.",positive
"Very tasty, very fresh.",positive
Not the cheapest way to buy these (that would be driving to Walmart) but 5 stars for convenience and getting the product straight from Bays with the freshest quality and best 'sell by date'! I love these for breakfast 'nuked' for 30 seconds per muffin with Land O Lakes 'butter with olive oil' Spread.,positive
"I purchased this many, many times while it was available. Then one day, I could no longer find it. Even a search multiple times to various stores and on the internet, netted a big zero.  There are still links for it out there if one is persistent enough, but it's no longer available for purchase anywhere.A smooth black tea with wonderful creme caramel flavour.  Not overpowering and not weak.  A great blend!  Good hot or cold!",positive
These vegan snack balls are delicious!,positive
Great tea. This is what my English friends drink. It also make a great iced tea.,positive
"Purchased as Christmas gift, they loved it, would buy again",positive

The ingredient list in the packages I received is different than the ingredient list shown on Amazon.,negative
"Interesting item. Not as hot as I wanted but it does the trick. I use it as a sprinkle for pizza, tacos etc. Worth a try.",positive
"For some odd reason, the large grocery stores are not carrying this flavor anymore, at least not in our area (northern Arizona). I ordered a box of these and then realized when they came that now we have enough to store away for the zombie apocalypse! Believe me, though, they will be eaten!",positive
The flavor and the ramen itself is just subpar. Highly disappointed.,negative
I use this all of the time.,positive
This product is advertised as NESPRESSO compatible and it is NOT!!,negative
"I have failed to get a real spearmint leaves cut/seaved. In kitchen, sometimes, loose spearmint leaves dry up.They still maintain the sharp tingling bitterish taste. I really wonder how the seller calls this product as aromatic.",negative
"6 salisbury steaks in a pkg!! What's not to like??  When I'm on a budget, I'll buy 2 or more of these.  When I need a quick meal, I microwave 2 or 3 of the salisbury steaks with its brown sauce along with a $1 can or frozen pkg of mixed vegetables.  Then I make instant mashed potatoes with the $1 packets of Idahoan instant mashed potatoes flavored with herbs, garlic or chives and add them to the salisbury steak/vegetable meal, scooping up all that tasty brown sauce over the mashed potatoes.  It's an instant nutritious well rounded meal for about $3 with hardly doing anything!!!",positive
Taste good not overly sweet,positive
"Love the fact that these coffee beans are certified organic.  This coffee has a great flavor with no bitterness, just a mellow cup of coffee.  Makes excellent cold brewed coffee.  Will definitely be buying this again.",positive

"My husband loves Tangerine Orange Zinger tea, but it is hard to find.  I used to buy 2 to 4 boxes a week from a local grocery, but they decided not to carry it, and did not respond to my request to bring it back.  Other local stores charge $1.50 more per box, so I decided to look elsewhere.I found several places on the web that sell this tea, but I would have had to buy 24 boxes to get the price I wanted, AND pay shipping charges.  In the end Amazon offered the lowest price ($2.17/box), and no shipping cost when I bought $25+ worth of product.  That was only 12 boxes which may seem like a lot, but the tea is cellophane sealed, and won't go bad.  If you drink lots of tea buying from Amazon will likely be your best value.",positive
"I love this product. Just 1/2 a teaspoon of this dried hibiscus powder turns boring water into a tasty and healthy drink loaded with vitamin C. And factor in that it's a one pound bag, and you really get your money's worth. I'm buying more for some friends to try.",positive
Highly recommend! Gives me joy to water! Bought one- Feb 2021 & another in August 2021 both plants are thriving! Very happy!,positive
Used these on a candy bar for a kids theater cast party.  They ate more of these than they did the M&Ms or any other candy.,positive
"Pretty good considering its in a can you put on the shelf for 2 years. Chicken is a little dry, sauce a bit thin, but I havent found anything better thats not frozen. I tear the lid off and drink it cold out of the can. 2 minute meal and Im back to work. Worst thing is its hard to find even the mfr web site was of little help. They link to several retailers who never actually have it, so I randomly find it on amazon.",positive
"Horrible color, It is nothing to do with the picture, the pink is tacky, the cord is not thin, very thick and this makes hard to arrange the letters. Also, the letters are in a tacky glitter gold, looks incredible cheap. I am returning this.",negative
I wouldn't have survived my pregnancy without these things.  Love them,positive
"Love the candy, but I was sent the wrong flavor pack… 🤦🏻‍♀️",positive
For a low carb food...very good. Especially toasted!,positive
"These were stale, very old. Obviously been sitting in a warehouse for years. Will never buy again, not worth returning. Threw them in the garbage.",negative

I was highly disappointed in this product. It’s glass and it was broken when I received it. Probably should’ve packaged it better. I had to just throw it away. I didn’t want that mess all over my room.,negative
"this is the second time this has happened to me, whole foods' 50/50 organic blend goes rotten very quick, well before the best buy date. definitely to be avoided in the future.",negative
"Zero stars. Arrived in a torn package. The product had gone bad, it had a terrible odor. It was definitely beyond its expiry date. It had two sticky notes on it, both displaying two different expiry dates. I am sure both those dates were a lie. Brazenly flouting all norms regarding perishable items.",negative
"This is good on almost anything eggs and chicken are a no brainer, but using it with come lemon pepper on fish... utterly amazing.  I need to order more, I am going through it like crazy.",positive
"Delicious!  When I bought it it said 5, 1 pound bags.  It came as one, 5 pound bag.  I don't care but someone else may.  It's delicious, nutritious and my 2 year eats it.  That's about all I care about.  I'll definitely buy it again :)",positive
This is a very yummy snack mix filled with flavor and protein.  It is way more heavy on the nuts than I expected so it actually makes a filling great snack.  We liked the cheesy flavor and would definitely get this again.  Wish it came in a bigger bag!,positive
"...maybe more brewing ways should be mentioned in the package ? I tried one that is actually described on the label, was good, but the best taste I got with ""standard"" hojicha brewing mething (190F-200F for 1.30 min).",positive
Fresh and tastey!,positive
Great coffee. Best flavor ever,positive
Used on Belgium waffles.  Flavor and consistency were just right.  I will definitely buy it again.,positive
Having these once every blue moon is fine but this is not something I would want to eat often. It tastes just like described its just not good,negative
I'm on my eighth bag in less than 2 months if that tells you anything! I love them and I also get them for my birds because I know it's a good brand and it's a great price but seriously they are really delicious and fresh.,positive
I’m not really a fan of tea but this blend is absolutely delicious especially great for cold weather,positive
good one!,positive
I like using this in my Ramen noodle soups to add veg and flavor,positive
These were my favorite candies growing up but could never find them. They are just as good as I remember,positive
I have ordered these sunflower seeds before and they were great so I ordered another bag and just received and opened it. The taste was stale and tasteless. This was very disappointing and I am very dissatisfied with the product.,negative
All the candy is very hard ! Not fresh,negative

As a Brit I am very particular about my morning cup of tea.  This is the best English tea available in America and at a good price.,positive
Been buying this coffee for years.  My husband enjoys the dark roast flavor that we get with dark magic,positive
great tasting water in comparison to several others,positive
Great for beefstew,positive
I live in Maryland and our crab cakes are all lump crab meat with no fillers. With the 2 of these things put together it’s only a third of what we’re used to. The taste is awful. Can’t even describe it. Had to generously use tartar sauce to finish it. No stars.,negative
Absolutely the spice mix for burgers and steak. I receive so many compliments when using this. You can't go wrong. Loved it so much I ordered two more bottles so as to not run out. Brings out the flavor in my beef dishes.,positive
I do not buy Russian products,negative
"If chocolate is your weakness, this is your cure; it goes great with coffee or tea or even as a treat for guests-with a glass of cold water or milk!",positive
This is great salsa. I use it on almost everything and have for soon time. Not able to buy locally any more so will be ordering on Amazon just a great product can not do without. Thanks,positive
Just what I wanted and couldn't find-raisins without sugar added.  Very satisfied.,positive
We were in Cedar Key for a visit and found Tony’s restaurant. We had lunch and had the best clam chowder ever. Now we can order it online and it tastes just as good. Follow directions on the can for a taste sensation.,positive
"I usedthis to make peppermint bark for christmas gifts. It's super easy to use, hold an entire 12 ounce bag of chocolate melts. Awesome!",positive
I use it for snacks!,positive
poor taste not many chocolate chips,negative
I absolutely love these! They are my favorite gummy bears.,positive
Great for a cookie without gluten,positive
I bought this tea because I was looking for a nice caffeine free/ sugar free tea for the cold evenings. I had all kinds of herbal tea but they all had secret sugars. I read about this tea and thought I would give ti a try. It tastes really good. I love it with a bit of almond/coconut milk.,positive
The best sea salt on the market! Adds the balance needed to make food taste good.,positive
Order this right now !!!!!!!  This is delicious .  We like ours on graham crackers .  This stuff is so good !  Great snack .,positive
I like that it's quick and easy. You can have a cup of coffee in no time. And they have many flavors.,positive
"Only a couple weeks from receiving the order the boxes began to swell.  Never had this happen before.  Date says fresh until 2021, but had stomach cramps after using most recent box. Went to Costco and bought a case, and the boxes were all normal and felt great on it.  Contacting Amazon and So Delicious for assistance.",negative
There is something wrong with these. Reconstituted them and they smell like rot. Texture is also bad. Definitely not eating. What a waste.,negative
"I'm a big fan of all things sweet and salty and this does not disappoint. Healthy, but doesn't taste healthy if you know what I mean..",positive
"Go-to water for my wife, but has been hard to find locally. Glad we can get it for her through Amazon.",positive
I was so excited to get these bagels today only to be beyond disappointed that when they arrived they are moldy!!  And they don’t offer a refund! I should have read the fine print… I was overly excited to buy these bagels ! Lesson learned !!!,negative
Looking for the 3rd bottle,positive
Your product is visually most appealing and delicious. Thanks very much.,positive
Easy to use but does not dye dark colors and the eggs seem to have a bit of a spicy taste to them from the dye seeping through the egg shells,negative
Like That this does not promote tooth decay,positive
All the flavors are very tasty. Love em.,positive
Absolutely the best! Thirst quenching and leaves one feeling clean and lighter.,positive
Keep my tradition going! Love how it looks and made the plain cake memorable.,positive
My sister loves raw cashews and this was a great gift for her. Can't always find them easily and the quality was excellent.,positive
Easy for mixing with protein shakes.... great flavor,positive
Cures what ails you!!,positive
"This cereal is comparable to dog biscuits. It's mostly flavorless with a hint of honey. But the worst part is it is so rock hard, it cuts the roof of my mouth up when trying to chew it. And it's bizzare b/c even though it's super rock hard, it gets weirdly soggy yet still hurts your mouth to eat. Zero stars on this one",negative
BEST OF THE BEST---NOTHING NEG. TO SAY,positive
"Very tasty, a little bit pricey though...",positive
The after taste is horrible. Not a very good dry,negative
"The description clearly stated: “Total of 36, 1-Ounce Boxes of Raisins.”  What I got was 6 little box’s of raisins for $15..  The price would be about right for 36 box’s (because a six pack is about $3 at the sprouts near my house.  Now I have to return during the pandemic (not happy).",negative
This is the best tasting hot chocolate out there. I don't even need out a whole packet in to get a delicious rich chocolate flavor. It is a little more expensive but totally worth every penny!,positive
"Quite simply, this is the finest Mustard money can buy. This stuff is remarkably tasty, with a subtle horseradish hit that takes it to the next level. As someone who mixes my own mustard base sauces for competition at the World Championship of BBQ Cooking Contest, I'll say the fact that this stuff has multiple gold medals wins at comps does not surprise me. Amazing on cased or deli meats. If your'e a mustard fan, snatch up a jar and prepare to be amazed.",positive
I enjoy drinking green tea so I brought this item to try the different flavors mixed with green tea.,positive
I couldn't find this anywhere. So I'm glad it's on here. I like having a condiment option that doesn't have vinegar.,positive
"I got this to last between larger orders from another source, and the scent is not like what I usually use.  It makes me wonder if it was grown on the side of a highway or some other pollutants perhaps?",negative
"AMAZING quality tea, it actually tastes like ""Black Mango"". Let's be honest though, there's no such thing as a ""Black Mango"" tea plant.",positive
Loved the cool colada but can't find it anywear. Had great taste.,positive
The flavor is nasty. I tried each in the  variety pack with different amount of water. & The product is non-refundable.,negative
"Perfect dark chocolate - sweet but not too sweet, dark but not bitter.  Love the crunchy toasted coconut.",positive
Tastes gross not worth it at all. Highly don't recommend for kids or adults,positive
"Only I can make them as good, but love to send them as a gift.",positive
Nice tasting treat,positive
OK in all fairness these do break easily,negative
Love this flavor but cant find it in stores here close by...,positive
Just loved the way these beautiful stars made my cupcakes looks.,positive
Very happy with the seller!  Looking forward to trying this product.,positive
"I ordered these for snacks to take to the office and thought they might be a better alternative to the chips or candy they sometimes have for us. I was WRONG. The peanuts are very, very sweet and coated in sugar. The jerky was inedible; as they were either too hard to chew or mostly fatty (?) mushy pieces of rubber. The only saving grace were the sunflower seeds that I did enjoy.",negative
The packaging claims this is keto friendly.  It is NOT.  2 tsp contains 9g of carbs and you have you use it in higher quantities as sugar.,negative
The best most flavorful chai ever...and I've tried them all!!,positive
"We have tried many different brand of white cheddar for my popcorn. So far this is one of the best and it can be used for so many things. Great for adding flavor to veggies, burger meat, and even meat loaf.",positive
CAN NOT FIND THEM ANYWHERE ELSE!! I’ve looked at every store I’ve gone to and not sold there.  The most delicious jelly beans I have ever tastes!,positive
Definitivamente mas rico que las mismas capsulas del mismo nespresso... totalmente recomendado!,positive
"Found this years ago at the largest Christmas Craft Show in the US at Harrisburg, PA. I try to always have this on hand in case I have guests over. I usually use a better beer like Stella or Reingeist (Cincinnati).",positive
"I was excited to see this item on AMAZON, I have bot it before at TJMaxx /Marshalls and it was always fresh and tasty.I received my order and was so disappointed, the dulce de leche was NOT creamy and the guava was ok. After one bite I threw it out and tried another one. Again, not yummy, not tasty, the guava was gummy no flavor and the so called dulce de leche was hard. I threw out the bag. Even though the bag states its from PR does not taste like the candies I use to eat when I visited.",negative
This is a family favorite. Wonderful lime flavor that is not super sweet.,positive
Nice chunky vegetables and tastes just right.,positive
"Great deal, fun treat to pass out to students at school. No complaints with product or shipping, got through subscribe and save.",positive
"Very good, work well.",positive
Great for keto diets and diabetics,positive
"Love this product!Sweet, intoxicating cardamom. Nectar of the gods, breath of the immortals.",positive
"Zesty brings out the zest in popcorn. Plain popcorn in dull and tastes like nothing in your mouth. But you know, that smart buyer looks at that zesty cheddar seasoning and can not wait to go home and experience the taste. Why wait now, when you can enjoy that  zesty taste.",positive
"As other reviewers have said, this tastes much better than whole wheat pasta, and I prefer the texture as well over other whole-grained pastas I've tried. I want to branch out now and try some of Eden Organics other kamut pastas.",positive
This baba ghanoush taste exactly like it did when I used to buy it from their deli on Clement Street 25 years ago.,positive
"Good source of protein. Good to eat on vanilla wafers, bananas, crackers, apples, and graham crackers.",positive
"I love these bars, but like many people I found out that they are made in China! I thought I had found something really good. But I don't like to eat products from China. Especially when these could easily be made in Canada, the USA or even Mexico! Why do they need to be shipped from around the world?  When some of the ingredients come from the USA? Makes no sense. I will no longer buy this products until facilities in North America can be opened to produce them! Come on!",negative
"This purchase happened because I just stumbled upon this during a late night bored Amazon browse. This is simultaneously the best and worst purchase I have ever made. Yes, I am a 25 year old woman. Well past the age that binging on fruit snacks is socially acceptable. So I bought this and binged on my fruit snacks in the privacy of my own home like an addict or something, both enjoying myself but feeling deep shame about my life choices at the same time. Most of the 36 large bags were consumed in this fashion. But yet, I am not sorry. These fruit snacks are the bomb. Delicious and just like the ones I always got as a reward for being good when I was a kid. But the great thing about being an adult with an Amazon account is I can have them any time I want and there is nothing you can do about it, mom!In all seriousness, these were awesome. They were adult size bags and super convenient to be able to grab when I wanted a snack. Usually these bags are around $1.50 each at the store and I was able to get a variety box of 36 for 20 bucks. If you have a fruit snack addiction like I do then buy this. You won't be sorry.",positive
"Great bread, especially for those on a Keto Diet....using sparingly of course. I use a half a sheet a few times a week and it has never kicked me out of ketosis",positive
"I absolutely love this stuff for ice tea, got tea, salt substitute... It's amazing on fish ( I really like a lemony lemony flavor)",positive
I ordered the black tea and it is delicious.  Will order other flavors.  Knowing I can have quickly made ice tea is a plus!  I add stevia for a healthy sweetener.,positive
Item must have been stored for a long time. Partially melted and discolored. See photo. Very disappointing.,negative
Candy. Looks like coal. Tastes reasonably good. What I wanted.,positive
"Honestly can't go wrong for the price but if you're wondering how it tastes before committing to a 40 pk, it doesn't taste like hazelnut AT ALL. It really just tastes like wafers coated in sweet artificial chocolate,  the kind of chocolate you can get at the dollar store.",negative
"All good. C'mon, cookies & milk for breakfast? Can't get any better?",positive
These caramels are extremely buttery and melt in your mouth.  Some of the best I've ever had!,positive
My husband and I have these dinner every night. They have a really good flavor and are healthy.,positive
love it!!! I make half black tea and half apple tea in a pitcher weekly -- super good and refreshing,positive
"The snack is fine,  but they are broken to bits by the time we get them.  Maybe extra packaging???",negative
The damson preserves are a gift for my friends who loves them. I am sure she will enjoy  these and probably hoping for them in her stocking. Thank you.,positive
"Unfortunately, I live in Mesa, Az and the candy arrived melted and dried out... but can’t be returned.  I’m bummed I have to pay for something I’m going to throw away.",negative
"I have been using cocoa powder on a daily basis for years. Based on so many good  reviews for Viva Labs organic cocoa powder, I thought I would give it a try. I like it. It has a smooth chocolate taste, and feel. I don't notice the bitter taste that some cocoa powders have. I use mine for a cocoa drink and also in smoothies. I have not used for baking. Due to a problem in the shipping of my order, I had the occasion to deal with Viva Labs customer service department. Top notch people!!! They could not have been any more accommodating. I highly recommend. Enjoy!",positive
"When it arrived, the sealing were both open and some of the spread was on the jar. And mostly it fail to mention it had maltitiol (which they can't spell check before putting it on the label). And they shouldn't have said it's keto friendly when it's not, which got me mad I wasted my money on it.",negative
"Love this gum.  It's a little different from your traditional peppermint flavor.  I find chewing a tasty sugarless gum helps me on the days when I need to cut back on my food consumption, especially my weakness, sweets.  Plus, I've never seen this flavor in places where I shop.",positive
i USED THE MIKE AND IKE FOR FOOD,positive
Fresh!!!!I am glad it is not bigger as the world is not ready for that yet.,positive
"This is NOT suitable as a gift. The wood box is flimsy and the top is a thin plastic that can best be described as a little thicker than cellophane. Not only that, ours arrived with a large cut AND puncture in it. And it’s not eligible for return. This is absolutely unsuitable for a gift and not a good deal for just the tea, which is basically all you’re getting. This was a HUGE disappointment.",negative
"Never have tried these before…refreshing, taser great…love the flavors that I’ve tried…a little spendy, but worth the taste!!…;)",positive
"I had this first time at a girls’ neighborhood brunch.  I went home and immediately ordered it.  It is a very tasty gravy, much like my mom’s own gravy.  It will not disappoint if you love biscuits and gravy.",positive
This was the worst brittle I have ever tasted. It arrived broken into a fragments and was stale.I threw it away as it was not returnable.,negative
"Wow- I was very pleasantly surprised.  I had expected to have to add some extra flavoring (lemon, lime, raspberry etc.) to them, but it was not necessary at all.",positive
Can't write much since this item was not available. Did get a case directly from Wild Planet.,negative
Came stale usually great,negative
"Grand daughter lives unicorns.  Made her birthday cake, she loved it",positive
Not much else to say! Box was in good delivery condition... happy not crushed!,positive
"We were gifted a bag of these; yum! I like the excuse to have some chocolate with coffee - they enhance each other's favors and I always add some coffee to my chocolate cakes and brownies. Gotta keep them out of reach of the little one, tho. Great pick-me-up!",positive
Was having difficulty finding this in local stores so was extremely grateful to find on Amazon at a very good price.These are great for my husband's lunchbox with delicious flavor and freshness in every can.,positive
"These are THE best meatballs i've had short of my Grandmother's . Beats any and all premade/frozen products.  I use them for quick dinners after 2 hr work commutes. Brown, simmer in marinara and eat for the week.",positive
"This is a 7 ounce jar and I'm such a wimp, in a single serving of food meant for me I can use just a tiny, tiny amount, a bit at the very end of a teaspoon!  and my husband and son can't tolerate the heat in their food at all.  This has a rich flavor underlying the heat but I suggest you avoid this  if you aren't just crazy about superhot stuff.  In a lifetime I couldn't use 7 ounces of this!  :)  I'm not a fair judge. Nevermind my rating!",negative
These are so good! I have to limit how many I can eat! Thankfully they are in small bags and I have to pause after eating each bag. Great snacks for the plane or other trip.,positive
I love jasmine tea so this tea was good for me,positive
"We love this chili sauce, it has great flavor and is not as sweet as sweet chili sauce. I was almost in a panic when I saw our Whole Foods stopped carrying it when we were almost out and relieved to find it here on Amazon!! This brand makes great products, we like this other sauces too. Definitely worth trying, you won’t be disappointed.",positive
Very disappointed that product arrived 5 days past it’s expiration date. I ordered it two days ago.,negative
I love these !,positive
"Have bought these twice and have also recommended to friends and family. Works perfectly on my essenzia, not sure what others are using it on but they all love them as well. Flavor is comparable to official brand at a significantly better price. Will not go back to Nespresso brand",positive
The cashews tasted like peanuts. NOT GOOD!,negative
"I ordered this because it has stevia, not Sucralose in it. I add only about 2 teaspoons to a large mug of coffee with my 2% milk and I have enjoyed it.",positive
"Oat-ly is the best tasting of the oat milks and then they made ""full fat"" oat milk. Yum! Was already creamy but this takes it up a notch. Very satiating, you know that satisfying feel of fat, but healthy plant based oil fat. SO GOOD in morning coffee ! I make coffee oat milk latte at home, which is coffee with a heaping splash of full fat Oatlly. Honestly, all Oatly flavors are good ! kids like it too in cereal !",positive
"I chose this because licorice is good for gut issues and sore throats.  For a while I was dealing with hypereosinophilia and eosinophilic esophagitis which caused sore throats often.  Licorice was a good option to help soothe all that until I got it under control with other natural methods.The licorice here is fermented to enhance bioavailability of the numerous nutritious polyphenols found in the root.  There is also a lot of wonderful information about this product on the Mercola Market website.Received 2 very ample sized tubs perfect for making such things as tea or seasoning dishes.  Overall, no complaints or regrets.",positive
"Extremely small small loaf ,not the normal size,also shipped from offshore.",negative
"I ordered for my sister's birthday, she just received them and sent me a picture - they are BEAUTIFUL!!!!!They are so fresh she said - they were shipped quickly and arrived a day ahead of time, that was great!From now on, this is where I will be ordering my flowers.",positive
"A little too big but that's ok, good for stools (people figures sit on palms) instead of benchs. Cute.",positive
"Very tasty, good orange flavor.  Not sour like the lemon version if you don’t like sour.",positive
Arrived undamaged as it has any time I've ordered it. Good stuff.,positive
My wife love this Christmas gift!,positive
I don't even know where to start.  I think it's pretty obvious.,negative
I love peanut butter but it is so fattening. This is 1/2 the calories and tastes great. You just add water or milk and stir to whatever consistency you like. I have also stirred in homey and cocoa to make chocolate peanut butter. I have been buying this instead of regular peanut butter for at least 3 years now. The best!!!,positive
Careful of Expiration dates,negative
Is too watery😢 idk but is not my type... The flaver idk man i didnt like i got a sip of one and lefted there.,negative
"Very tasty! Season pork, steak and salmon. Thanks",positive
"So we didn’t get what was pictured. We got one with a banana on its head and the bride had a bow. Couldn’t get a new set in time, so I had to make a top hat out of clay and glue tulle on the girl. It’s good quality and cute. Wouldve been better if we got the ones we were supposed to",negative
"Great taste, probably too strong for some. Used these in homemade Chex mix, they made it my best to date.",positive
Not impressed with flavor or intensity,negative
I recommend these Mulberries to people who her into healthy foods I first heard about it on the TV and gave them a try pretty good on my cereal.,positive
Fresh and in time. thank you.,positive
Lavazza coffee Crema e Gusto is excellent an very creamy. The quality is very reliable,positive
I made this cake and thought it would taste great and rise just like a regular cake does. This was not the case this cake did not taste like cake taste to me anyway it seemed really spongy to me. I would not recomend this product.,negative
I bought the 10ct for my brother who loves all things Japan.  He adores this tea and will be buying it on his own next month.,positive
This tasted nothing like the Taco Bell sauce,negative
My ice tea just fits into the container.  I would buy it again.,positive
A family tradition in our house. Very yummy treat!!,positive
The label on this coffee says “SMOOTH” and it lives up to the name. It needs neither creamer nor sugar to cover up a bitter burnt-bean flavor.,positive
This cake tastes like the one you buy in the Caribbean! It is oh so good!,positive
Awful.  Tiny tiny tiny and not hullless that’s for sure!,negative
Great taste and great flavor.  No carbs and no calories.  Love this flavor--tastes like fresh berries,positive
Love spam!,positive
This came in a box the candy looked old and melted. I tried to return. No return,negative
"The item says ""pack of 2"" but I only received one?? Can you explain?",negative
My kids love it ! Taste kinda fresh :-),positive
Making cranberry wine for Thanksgiving and these arrived frozen and were in great condition in my opinion.  Very satisfied with my purchase.,positive
Love these! I do not feel guilty having a little sweet eating these! I love the taste of each one!,positive
Not one broke. Very fresh and delishish,positive
I was very disappointed to see that the “package of 2” turned out to be only ONE package. I have bought these at the grocery before and know what a two-pack looks like and this wasn’t it. There is no way to get my money back because I had to use them for the sausage I made but I needed more.,negative
This is easily the best of the tuna snacks.,positive
"Okay, so it's normal lemon juice. But I did not read everything, and ended up with SO MANY BOTTLES. 10/10 good product, 0/10 on consumer reading the label.",positive
"Great product, use it as a lotion and the main ingredient in making my toothpaste. If you research what is in commercial toothpaste you will throw it away and make your own.",positive
Wonderful for cleaning off line buildup! It is a miracle. No more sore arms from scrubbing the glass door to my shower! And the faucet looks almost brand new now! Completely floored by how a non-toxic solution could perform so well. I am recommending it to anyone who is willing to try it!:),positive
Dose not taste like banana . And had the texture of rubber🤮,negative
Second time buying no problem..taste great,positive
It was so old disgusting 🤢,negative
"Love the everything bagel seasoning, can't beat this price.",positive
"This German-style flatbread is great toasted. It is a pretty moist bread, so, it takes a few rounds of toasting in my toaster oven to get it crispy. Eating the bread untoasted doesn't make sense to me, as the bread will A) fall apart, due to its fragility when untoasted, and, B) it won't taste anywhere near as good raw as it does toasted. I like the flavor of the multi-grains, and the bread contains plenty of fiber.The packages don't need to be refrigerated until they are opened, and will keep for a few months.",positive
Good and crispy!,positive
Too strong for my taste,negative
Using this as one ingredient for a bulletproof drink for surge of protein and for skin and hair.,positive
ran into a random store in seattle and this is accidentally one of best gummy bear I've ever purchased,positive
My favorite soup and often sold out at the supermarket. I'm so happy I can buy large quantities on Amazon.,positive
Seems to be fresh. I love buying organic! Just ordered Tumeric as well. Good value on both,positive
Bold and tasty dark roast.  One of the smoothest cup of coffee I have ever had.  I also love the fact that it is organic and is free of pesticides.  Thank you Lifeboost and Amazon for providing such a fine product.  I will definitely keep some of this one in the house.,positive
I love the taste. Real watermelon!,positive
We made chicken cheese spaghetti!,positive
Just a very sweet liquid. No taste beside excessive sweetness. Very disappointing. I opened only one of the three bottles and now I am told it is in eligible for return so I spent $20 for this.,negative
"Excellent taste, but a bit saltier than the other sea salts I have. I would buy it again, although it’s a bit too pricey.",positive
"Good quality coconut flour. I have been following a Ketogenic, LCHF way of eating for almost a year now & I use coconut flour in my baking goods... bread, cakes, cupcakes, pancakes... It is delicious & kid approved.",positive
"I enjoyed this granola as a healthy, grain-free not- too -sweet snack.",positive
"Wonderful, great size, very fresh and clean!",positive
First time using this product.  The added flavors make you dish pop!,positive
Fit the theme perfect tasted good too,positive
"These red chocolate covered cherries are so so good!! I used to get them from a company that charged about the same amount to ship them as the cherries themselves! So, I gave these a try before giving them as a gift and they were absolutely fabulous!! You will not be disappointed. Except when there are no more in the bag...lol. Many thanks!",positive
Syrupy and great for steamed vegetables and fruits like strawberries.,positive
I ordered the toasted marshmallow sugar-free. This is a complete waste of money there is no flavor whatsoever. Only a very strong sugar-free aftertaste. No toasted marshmallow flavor at all. I only use sugar-free flavorings and this is so strong with a bitter aftertaste I cannot use it. Zero flavor. Gross,negative
I enjoyed the product!,positive
"Nice product, large crystals which I love.  Fast shipping and this is a repeat order.",positive
"These were shipped in a paper envelope which had obviously had a heavy item dropped on it. The crackers were completely smashed.  Why these weren't shipped in a box is beyond me.  Unfortunately, the disappointment didn't end there.  While what was left of a few of the the crackers were very fresh, there was absolutely no hint of cheese flavor.  I usually buy the White Cheddar variety but since they weren't available, I figured the Grilled Cheese would be just as good.  Nope!  Will never buy these again.",negative
So cute! Came super fast!,positive
"these are completely delicious.  Super item, great price.",positive
Its fresh and the sheets doesn't rip thank gawd!,positive
"Tastes just like what my Great Grand Mother made years ago !!!It's natural with out MSG !Can not have MSG it gives me Migraines, I was thrilled when I came across this product.",positive
BEST TASTING PEPPER AROUND,positive
My wife loves this tea. Nice taste.,positive
Love this sausage. Best tasting veggie sausage I've tried so far and I've tried a LOT!,positive
"Great tasting coffee with the added benefit of mushrooms, to support cognitive function.",positive
Excellent product. Exactly what we had hoped for and with the care and concern for quality food that we had expected. We will order again!,positive
So cute worth money,positive
"When I opened the package, it was extremely dark in color, and it definitely tasted a little off. Maybe it’s because it was vegan? But it did not taste good to me.",negative
I cannot believe this product! It tastes just like spaghetti but with significantly less carbohydrates. It absorbs the flavor of whatever sauce you put on it. I will now purchase their rice! So amazing!,positive
I couldn't even bite into them... I was embarrassed when I gave one to the neighborhood children and they couldn't even eat them. Thier mother had just gotten a fresh box from Costco and they brought me some of theirs because they felt bad for me. Humiliation central! NEVER AGAIN!,negative
The best honey. I ll buy it again.,positive
Love these lollipops. Great taste!,positive
Taste like I was eating paper...where is the flavor ????,negative
"Super fine, great in my baked goods as an alternative.  The bag is huge, 5 lbs, so it will last awhile.",positive
"I have heard that this type of tea is very healthy.  I enjoy the flavor with honey, and will order it again.",positive
My Orchid flower plant only lasted two weeks.  I followed the instructions on how to care of them and it didn't help..,negative
"I bought it during VegFest in Durham in 2022. Then ordered another one on Amazon. Subtle, hot, very tasty. Delicious! One of the best sauces out there. Also local for NC residents. Huge respect to the chef!",positive
"I've used this brand a lot in the past since it seems to be the only unsweetened coconut I can find in my local grocery stores. Was very happy to find it online in bulk. I use it primarily for coconut and golden milk, but have also toasted it, used it in baking and used it raw in toppings. Looks like the same quality as the ones in the store. I bought the 22lb bag in July of 2019 and the expiration date isn't until November of 2020. I'll have it used up well before then.",positive
Love these old fashioned treats.,positive
"I wanted to make gluten-free 7-layer bars for Christmas. The bottom layer is graham cracker, so I bought this product. I was worried at first, because the texture after mixing with melted butter was very runny, even after adding extra crumbs. But, I tried it anyway, & it tasted great!  The crust didn’t crumble at all, & was as just the right taste & texture. Yummmm!",positive
Good but hot.,positive
So good and made the hot dogs taste great on he Memorial day cook off,positive
Love these.  I’m obsessed!!! Best dark chocolate !!!!,positive
Love the portion size 8 or 9 to a bag,positive
Amazingly yummy!!!😊,positive
A little high priced but I will buy again.  I love it!,positive
"This product is very consistent in quality, and very inexpensive from Amazon especially with Prime.  It has a good flavor and texture.",positive
"perfect taste for me not too strong, not too light i dint drink black coffee but i can drink this one without any cream....",positive
"Had I known, I would never had spent money on this.  It really tastes that bad to me.",negative
"The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - ""Is the piston firing short?"" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very lovable and very intelligent too. Her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours. The hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well. Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? The puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well. It's awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival. It loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the US Govt. I don't see why it doesn't figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. Great Movie, it has the presidential seal of approval on it!",positive
"Heard about this through a friend - use it in my smoothies. It's a great way to get the protein of Peanut Butter without all of the calories. It lasts a long time and has a really 'natural' peanut butter taste. I don't recommend it for making straight-up peanut butter though, that hasn't worked out so well for me. I just use it for smoothies and I'm happy.",positive

"I never leave Amazon reviews. BUT. OH MY. This is superb! I had to be leave one for this. I became obsessed with Thai Tea and was spending way too much money on it, I tried making it homemade from recipes I found on the internet, then I found this gem. I can't get enough of it!",positive

"This Morin Blackberry Puree seems to indeed be that, but really it is a very very thick, very sweet, syrup.  It definitely has a full, rich, delicious blackberry flavor and aroma (and color), but you have to be prepared to use it only where lots of added sugar is ok.  Also, being fundamentally a puree after all, it has teensy tiny bits of blackberry flesh, so it won't be making some crystal clear drink in case that's what you're imagining.",positive
Very good. Thick and creamy with outstanding taste,positive
"I have tried several types of loose tea, even some ridiculously expensive, but I find Davidson's the best.  The Earl Grey is wonderfully scented, and the tea seems fresh and makes a delightful pot.  This package is an excellent value as well.  I never plan to be without it.",positive
"This is just exactly as I wanted. It takes about a little fingernail size scoop to sweeten my hot drink or 2 to sweeten a tall glass of lemonade. It is pure and not mixed with artificial sweeteners like truvia and stevia in the raw are. It leaves no aftertaste at all, just sweet. I love it!",positive
Almonds are fine but the bag was broken and it was not very appetizing. They were in an outer bag that was sealed but still not what I would expect.,negative
Very good taste and freshness.,positive

"Great sugar, perfect for coffee! It adds a very nice, even, and delicious sweetness to whatever you add it to. Dissolves quickly. I also really like the unevenness of the cubes; adds a little artisticness/originality to each cube! This is a great deal as a two-pack.",positive
Love this product. I actually put it on ice cream.,positive
"Great flavor, great price! Wish they had this flavor available in the big bulk container.",positive
"I am enjoying this sprouted flour.  It is fresh tasting and this is the only way I can eat wheat flour.  I did awful on the gluten free flours.  I make some great muffins from this flour and my family is enjoying them very much.  I would buy this product again as I really, really don't like sprouting my own flour.",positive
"Best biltong that I have found in the USA.  Biltong is South African dried strips of steak, with just a few spices (very important).  MUCH better than any American jerky, and less fatty too.  Almost like my dad used to make every winter in SA, more than 60 years ago.  I am a regular buyer, for me and my daughter.  Heartily recommended.  Oh yes. it comes already sliced.",positive
Amazing!! Only wished I had more. Great flavor and very soft!!,positive

"these are the best sunflower seeds, and i've tried a lot.  my least favorite flavor of these is still better than most other producers in my favorite flavor.  really like the hatch chile, bbq, and parmesan pepper.  Cinnamon toast is better than I thought it would be, was a bit wary of that one, but it's pretty enjoyable when a little bit of sweet is what I'm craving.",positive

This arrived with 4 of the twelve cans damages and unsafe to eat--truly dented at the top or bottom or can seams.

Love it use it all the time works perfect only thing I say is to soak your pork belly 1 hour after rinsing it and let it dry overnight before you smoke it. You won't have any salty issues.,positive

These taste like Stale chips or stale Cereal. I’m not impressed and I would not waste your money.,negative
"I bought these peas multiple times before and they were delicious, but this time I bought 3 packs at once but all 3 of them are either stale or made badly. The peas are darker in color than the ones I ordered before, and are very hard. The seasoning seems to be the same but it's hard to tell because they taste burnt. I opened many of the smaller packs to see if any of them were acceptable but so far it looks like I'll have to throw them out. What a waste :(I'm just disappointed because I don't know if I want to order them again if there's a risk of them being this bad again.",negative
Too expensive for the amount you receive. Do not recommend,negative
"Flavors and textures are very good-be aware the Carolina BBQ has a wetter or tackier feel, though texture base is as firm.  Smoked black pepper is fabulous.  Meat free for over 25 years and this is the best vegan jerky by far.  A bit pricey but worth it for the savory treat of flavors usually reserved for meat.",positive
Just another tea it's ok but lower BS don't think it dose anything. Just a lot of money for cheep tea,negative
"Excellent product, excellent service!!!",positive
I am not Thai and don't have a lot of experience cooking Thai food. This curry paste is fantastic and I think even better than our favorite Thai food locally. I would recommend to use sparingly and taste as you add to coconut milk. This is super tasty. My husband and 3 year old absolutely loved it! We will buy it again.,positive
This was a party favorite.,positive

This product is defective.  The milk pods explode.  It says your not eligible for a refund but thats not the case.  Contact Amazon customer service for help.  They will take care of it. And do not buy these,negative
These are a great vegan/organic alternative to cheez Its/gold fish crackers. I like how all the ingredients are organic and they taste good.  Notice how the main ingredient is chickpea flour vs enriched flour for similar products. These make a good snack -- just portion out a serving because they are addictive!,positive
Bueno y económico ya que estoy guardando alimentos y durará varios años,positive
"Okay this flavor and the aroma it gives off from your mug? UNREAL! Love love love this blend and have been using it to start my mornings every day to help get my body moving and my liver that extra support! Once again, I will definitely be ordering. You seriously cannot find the quantity/quality tea for the price they offer! GREAT company that I can definitely stand behind.",positive

"When you eat oatmeal just about every day you learn that most Oatmeal products are not what they say and end up not having the taste and texture that you crave in a cereal.  Scots Porage without question has excellent flavor with out the texture that makes you feel like your eating flack and not the softness to make you feel like your eating mush.It cooks up in pretty good time and the instant can be cooked in the microwave if you are in a hurry to get out the door.If you are into making your own Oat cakes ""Which is essentially Oatmeal, Butter and water"" this oatmeal also works out the best.",positive
"I use this to sweeten ice tea, homemade seltzer water drinks and homemade ice cream.  In drinks I use 1 drop (I put the sucralose in glass dropper bottles) with a few drops of liquid stevia and to me it tastes just like sugar but it doesn't raise my blood sugar or take me out of ketosis.  In ice cream I use this along with a small amount of pure stevia powder and substitute the sugar called for in the recipe with erythritol and even my grandkids can't tell that it isn't sweetened with sugar!  It's a great sweetener on its own, but mixed with a little stevia and/or erythritol and I can't tell that it isn't sugar.  Very happy with this purchase.8 months later, an update.  My wife & I have been using this in all kinds of baking — cookies, brownies, cheesecake, custard, etc.  We use erythritol & inulin powder to replace the bulk of sugar, we put a very small amount (depending on size of recipe, maybe 1/8 - 1/4 tsp) of pure stevia powder in and then sweeten to taste with this liquid sucralose.  The finished product tastes just like it was sweetened with sugar!  If recipe calls for brown sugar, just add a little molasses and you have brown sugar.  It is so nice to be off of sugar & have a substitute that doesn’t affect my blood sugar (I’m a type 2 diabetic).  I mostly eat fat & protein now, but when I desire a treat, it’s nice to have a sweetener that (along with almond flour & other tricks) allows us to bake things that are healthy & satisfying.",positive
"Often dates are dry so I was very pleasantly surprised that the Terrasoul dates were moist and tasted quite fresh. I will have no hesitation to purchase again. I go through dates rather quickly because they are exceedingly nutritious (not to mention delicious). They are great on their own, in smoothies, can be used to make dressings and marinades and a great substitute for anytime you want to replace processed sugar - which I no longer eat. They also arrived on time. Glad to recommend these to friends - and you! Jan 2020 - another order and I'm still pleased. UPDATE:I ordered 3 packages once again and I'm very pleased with the moistness and taste. Will gladly order again and glad to recommene.",positive
Best variety and wheat in the mix like others.  Taste delicious.,positive
"SO STALEThey kind of hurt my teeth to eat. I learned about these after a coworker came back from our overseas office in the Netherlands. Oh man, so flaky and crisp, contrasted with the soft and syrupy filling. They were amazing!But THESE. These have mixed together in all the wrong ways. The wafer has sucked moisture out of the filling, causing it to oddly flexible and rubbery, while the filling, sapped of its juiciness, is more like old taffy in consistency. Super sad. :(I've read that there's another brand that has sealed packages and don't get this stale, so I'll be trying that instead.",negative
"We ordered 2, 12-packs of this product.  7 out of the 24 cans burst open during shipping and soaked the entire box.  We liked the product that had not opened but we lost more than 25% of the total product during shipping.  Won't buy from this vendor again.",negative

"These weren't purchased for me, but for my mother. I wanted her to have a healthier, more nutritious hot dog that wasn't filled with toxic, cheap by-products like almost every other hot dog in the grocery store.According to her, the snapback is amazing. They are flavorful and actually more beef than viscera. She says that these are some of the best hot dogs she's ever had. A small price to pay for a good quality hot dog- and good health.",positive
"The richest-tasting butter that never gets rock hard as some others do. More expensive, but so worth it!",positive

These bars are tasty and filling.  I enjoyed them.,positive
These are very convenient to take to work instead of a big jar of parmesan.  Same quality as jar but with added convenience and portability.  LOVE!,positive
"I really do LOVE this shake mix. The 5 star rating is strictly for the shake mix. As for cost, this can be bought at iherb for $15 and change, and free shipping if your order totals enough. I will likely get it there exclusively from now on.",positive
One of my favorite teas sold in bulk.,positive
10/10 Everyone should try these sauces.,positive
"They arrived with a powdery white coating on them.  Didn't  seem fresh, flavors were muted.  Since this was a gift I drove an hour and bought the same item from a See's store in a mall.Very fresh, no white powder.  Strong aroma and taste,",negative
"This product is listed on the Amazon website as ""Liqua-Gel"" but it is a watery liquid, not gel at all. The product that arrived is labeled ""6 Color Neon Airbrush Food Coloring Kit""--no claims to be liqua-gel. The deepest colors that are possible with this product are pastel, as many other reviewers have pointed out. The photos of cakes that are included with the five-star customer reviews of this product that show deep rich colors could not possibly have been made with this product. Amazon should correct its website.",negative
"OK so maybe I could live without this porcini powder, but I prefer not to. I have a hard time getting fresh mushroom regularly where I live so this powder adds a beautiful mushroom flavor to canned mushrooms. Even when I make dishes with fresh earthy mushrooms, the powder adds that extra richness to my recipes.  I just made a sausage bean soup that didn’t require mushrooms, and it was incredibly delicious, but after adding some porcini powder, it took it to another level.This will be a must for my pantry from now on",positive
I picked this because there was a variety and I wasn't sure which one I would like.  They were all good and fresh!,positive
Just buy them!  They are gummy bears!,positive
Perfect tv snack. Arrived on time & in great condition.,positive

I think that this is the best tasting Asiago I have ever had.,positive
The best creamer out there - and the healthiest in my opinion.,positive
Taste better than table salt. Table salt is poison.,positive
I would return these if I could for deceptive advertising.These are plain sugar cookies.They are NOT snickerdoodles.I am very very disappointed.,negative
Tastes like fruit,positive
No matter how much a shook the creamer chunky bits floated to the top. It had the same bitter taste that soy milk has when it goes rancid too. I think I got spoiled creamer but there is no where to do a return on this product.,negative
I guess I should have read the description better!  I am very unsatisfied that there were only 36 little creamer cups in this.  I can get a 50 count for under $5 at the store and I should have driven there. It would have taken 3 gallons of gas plus the purchase to make it the same cost.,negative
It was shipped via USPS And placed in mailbox on a very hot day.  Luckily I was looking for it because USPS delivers at various times of the day.The cheese was great.,positive
Really cute and will look great on my cake,positive
"This is inexpensively priced and gest here quickly.  Buy this product and you will see how the various chain and local ""Health Food Stores"" are ripping you off.",positive
"I'm a Crystal Light fan from way back in the 1980's. This is the sweetest tea, with a sweet finish.It does have caffeine, which is sadly a problem for me, so I cannot drink it after 1pm.I'd LOVE CL to make a caffeine-free version of THIS, or really, of all the teas....so far, lemon is the only one we can get decaf.I miss the original TEA which was just tea without lemon or mint, etc.I wish the other flavors could have the same sweetness this has....same sweet, smooth finish. It's amazing and the first time I tried this I drank a TON and did not sleep for an entire night and day....",positive
No cashews in the mix. False advertising picture on packaging. BAD!!!!!,negative
Perfect and cheapCoffee,positive

grest preserves,positive
Yeah the “Japanese Wasabi” printed on the bottle when everything else was in Japanese should have been a giveaway that this stuff is a marketing ploy to mark up the price on some horseradish definitely doesn’t taste authentic and certainly isn’t worth the money would recommend just going to whole foods for an authentic experience(Only reason I gave 2 stars is because it served it purpose and I used it on my sushi still),negative
The best ever for flavor,positive
My husband is diabetic and this product does not elevate his sugar levels...,positive
good tasting w healthy mushrooms,positive
This was a repeat order.  It is so much better then regular vanilla flavoring.,positive
Perfect snack for for a Type A blood person!.,positive
"I grew up eating this soup in Northern Vermont.  They don't have this in Tucson where I now live, it's great being able to enjoy this again",positive
I just tried these and was surprised at how good they are. Tasty and satisfying. One bag has two servings and can be resealed with ziplock. I was satisfied with half the bag and I'm usually not. Nice texture but more crumbly than a normal crispy cheese cracker. It's to be expected with almond flour but it's pleasant enough. Slight aftertaste but nothing crazy. a bit pricey but what isn't nowadays,positive
I had a tea party and the individual packages where perfect for it.,positive
I am traveling to Scotland soon and enjoy Scottish Breakfast tea.  I was pleased to find the Brodies Tea bags because of the convenience of using them.,positive

"Great cup of coffee. Again, Caza Trail comes trough with a terrific blend.I like this for a morning pick up type coffe",positive
"I love it for breakfast because even though it has raisins it is not sweet as others. I did not buy it regularly because it is expensive, but buying the whole big package allows me to save some good money.",positive
"I bought three different flavors of the Sweet Earth Breakfast Burrito: Protein Lovers, Burrito Baja and Big Sur, The other two are good, but this flavor Burrito Baja tastes terrible! It is full of mashed potato, with some tiny ham pieces. And it is tasteless, no taste at all! I had to add many extra ranch sauce so I can eat it. Don't buy this one! The other two flavors are good.",negative
"This salsa is delicious! It’s tastes very similar to the ghost pepper salsa, but imo this is better. I recommend pairing this with Paqui Ghost Pepper chips! 🤤🔥",positive
Some salty and have chili but it's good,positive
"Let’s be honest, apple cider vinegar does not taste good. This one tastes a touch better than most but it’s still gross. So why 5 stars? Because it seems to help my rather severe digestive  issues.  Got diagnosed with collagenous colitis just over a year ago. I’ve been on steroids and other meds that helped for a bit, then as soon as I came off of them, right back to inflammation.  Tried these. And my tummy issues seemed better than they have since the diagnosis.I don’t think you really need it if you’re lucky enough not have such an annoying digestive system.  But if, like me, you need both pro and pre biotics to just function? This is one of the better tasting options. Also it’s just a good quality brand.",positive
Love Brachs. Same review as above,positive
Luv luv,positive
"as delicious as I imagined.  roasted perfectly.  nice substitute for coffee or cocoa, without the caffeine, but probably not worth the expense to keep doing it.",positive
We love this pizza sauce.,positive
It tastes like a freshly brewed cup of coffee but it’s so much quicker and easier!!,positive
There is so little vanilla bean extract in this brand that there’s no flavor. I used it in making a cake and the cake tasted like cardboard. There’s so much alcohol in it that it covers up any vanilla extract that may be in it.,negative
Positive -These are real combos. Price. Would be good for a childs lunch.Negative - It took so long to receive them I was afraid they would be stale by the time I received them.Be warned these are small bags of combos. The size you would give out for Halloween. These are not something you would give an adult for a lunch.,negative
awesome packaging and good taste.,positive
It is very good but very very expensive!!!,positive
"Not much I can say, its a good product and came unscathed.",positive
"A big sticky mess and flavors are off. When we opened individual fruit slices, there were so sticky, it was wet & watery sugar dripped out of each packet.  Not sure what flavors these are but didn't have a fruity flavor. Really disappointed.",negative

Perfect to take to work!!,positive
"The best low carb I’ve had yet. Has a bit of chewiness to it, but flavor is just like regular bread. This is a lifesaver.",positive
"I like to try different beans and compare them. My preference is a rich coffee taste with no bitterness. After reading the reviews on this coffee, I decided to try it. I definitely agree with the comments on this coffee and will continue to buy it. I've noticed with some others that I've purchased that the first bag is great, and then other bags are a bit dried out. As long as this source provides me with the quality and freshness of this first bag, you have a customer! Thank you!",positive
Exceeded my expectations. Got it today. So sparkly and pretty.,positive
"This is a great inexpensive truffle cream perfect for flavoring meat, lamb & putting it on toasted crackers on broil with cheese. Yes, You can spend $$$$  on truffle products with more flavor but I think a little truffle flavor goes a long way.  It shouldn't be the only flavor component of your dish. Too much truffle over powers dishes.  This is perfect.",positive
I love this drink!! The blood orange is my favorite.,positive
very good taste would recommend even good for gifts,positive
Our fuzzy friend is very picky. He only eats the sunflower seeds out of all critter mixes. Loves these seeds!,positive
"I tried the Gatorade and Powerade, well they have changed the way they made Gatorade since I was young. It really taste like a soda to me now. Bodyarmor really taste great and doesn't leave and after taste. When my DR specifically told me I needed to drink more drinks like this I was on a mission to find something that I could stand to drink . This is the best Sports Drink I have found.",positive
"Extremely disappointing.  Was looking forward to sweetness for my coffee, but there is nothing sweet about this package.  Started off with a micro teeny tiny, can hardly see it amount.  NOTHING,  but a bitter taste.  Added same again.  Even more bitter.  Had to throw the nasty tasting coffee away.  No returns...lovely.  Sticking with the Natural Mate sucralose & erythritol blend, which is super sweet, no AFTERTASTE.",negative
Love this stuff and you can't beat the price.,positive
"Once you tried this tea there’s no way you can ever use any other brand. Sweet or unsweetened It’s is terrific.  The name says it all “Pure”.  No nasty artificial flavors, sweeteners, or color additives. I get migraines and my doctor suggested tea along with my medication and it really helps. Another wonderful perk of this great product.",positive
Tasty and works fine. Only alternative is RED ROSE which is too high price due to Canada import,positive
Great coffee with a great flavor!,positive
Great tasting coffee. I love that it is organic.,positive

This coffee is delicious. It makes perfect lattes and is the real thing that they make at the French Market in New Orleans. Get yourself some beignet mix and you are in business.,positive
"A great snack at any time and the right portion too.  My husband doesn't usually go for any kind of chip unless it's slathered in spices and extra stuff, but he loves these too.  Definitely one of my favorite go to snacks!",positive
Has a real maple syrup flavor and taste.  Nothing artificial on my tastebuds.  It is thin. I'm doing Keto.  Highly recommend.,positive
"If you are expecting this to be just like regular pasta, you will be disappointed.  The taste and texture are different than your typical pasta.  If you are looking for something so that you can have spaghetti minus the carbs, this is a great alternative.  I have to keep my carbs low, but really missed spaghetti.  Prep is easy, much easier than Zoodles (spiralized zucchini).  I like to keep a stash handy as it makes a quick easy low-carb meal.",positive
I love this coffee.  It is not strong.,positive
"Yum.  My husband is diabetic and I have searched and searched for a good hot cocoa.  This is really, really delicious.  I microwave about a half a mug of water, put two teaspoons of the cocoa into the boiling hot water, stir well (really stir well) until it is well incorporated.  Then, I add a packet of Truvia and top off with heavy whipping cream -- enough to make it as creamy as I want. Stir more. It's decadent and easy to make.",positive
Kids just loves these,positive

Flavor is great!  My husband and I snack on them all the time!,positive
Love the nacho cheese flavor.. Used to get these from the ice cream truck in my old neighborhood after school.  Never could find this flavor in any store or gas station.  Its like i see every other flavor but this.  Not sure why I guess its thexleast popular,positive
"Love this brand, fantastic flavor.",positive
"The best blend of spicy, smooth, rich, and robust flavors.  It’s a treat with a touch of honey and your favorite frothy nut milk! It’s so delicious, I feel indulgent and guilty drinking it all by myself before my busy work day begins! (family requesting breakfast).",positive
Ordered these on 9/30/20 at about 10pm. The weather has been cool all around the country. Was home when they were delivered on a cool day less than 48 hours later and picked up the box one minute after it was delivered. The almonds were completely melted into one giant mess! The protein bars in the same box were fine.What this probably means is that this seller has a large supply of these almonds that were melted earlier this summer and now they are trying to recoup their losses by shipping the melted chocolate almonds to fools like me who read all the reviews and saw all the pictures posted of melted chocolate almonds but still ordered because of the recent cool weather. Check out the reviews of the other chocolate products from yupik that are also melted. Very dishonest and slimy! I will never order anything from yupik again and consider this seller to be the scum of the earth!,negative

"I bought these food colors so I could make my own foam soap and make it into different colors. Very easy to make. You can buy the soap dispenser on Amazon. Mix 1 c. of your favorite body wash (Bath and Body has some good smelling body washes including men's scents, or you can buy Mrs. Meyer's in almost any store such as Target, Walmart, or Walgreens) then add hot water to the soap and swirl around lightly to mix the soap with the hot water or stir it once you have it in your soap dispenser. You can even buy a jug of soap at Sam's Club. As long as your soap is clear or white creamy soap you can add the food color and make your soap any color you want. It works great, you save money on soap over the long haul and you waste a lot less soap and water and don't sacrifice on the clean part.",positive
All the candy was melted very disappointed,negative
"I'm a huge popcorn fan and make a bowl nearly everyday.  This corn pops good and the taste is fine.  The problem I have with it is the hulls, not un-popped kernels, but the little shells surrounding the kernels. Seemingly more than any other popcorn I've ever used. They were just crazy.  Actually a distraction when eating them.  Chasing the little bits of crazy around in your mouth.  I hate wasting things, so we finished the bag, but was sorry for my purchase. It's like a 12 lb bag and appeared to go on forever.  I did contact the company who didn't seem too concerned about it.",negative

"What the hell? Maybe 60% or the “gumballs” in the bag were actually balls of something tasting and looking like Tootsie Rolls covered in the gum candy shell. Let me tell you, it is NOT a pleasant experience to bite into what you think is a gumball only to find a solid lump of Tootsie Roll! After many unpleasant surprises, I finally got wise and weighed the balls - the actual gum is lighter than the imposter gum. The actual gum is good - it’s the psychological torture of not knowing what I’m about to bite into that I object to!",negative
Make sure you understand the quantity you are getting. I wasn't paying attention and expected the bigger-sized soda bottle. I am still happy with it and actually like it better. You will likely use it up before it goes flat...,positive

My 3 year old son loves these lollipops. He's been very resistant to potty training and I think the only reason he cares about peeing on the potty is because he knows that he'll get a lollipop as a reward.,positive

"Ordered this product, four jars of lingonberry preserves in plenty of time for Christmas delivery. For the sake of full disclosure, I must thank Amazon for providing a $20 voucher for not getting this present to our home in time for Christmas.However, we must advise future buyers that Amazon indiscriminately substitutes three larger jars for four smaller ones. On the surface this deal appears a boon, but when distributing the jars to others, three jars is not four.Just be aware that you may get three jars or four. The reason is puzzling.Also, this product shipped direct from Amazon LLC and not from a third-party vendor. Amazon can fix this uncertainty if it so wishes.",negative

This is beyond amazing! I put this glaze on everything. Tastes so good.,positive
"I was shopping for a good whole wheat cracker and I thought these might be good. Disappoint #1. The size of these crackers is very small and thin. The texture and crispness is best described as stale. As for the taste, they are fairly bland. If you like cardboard, then these might be for you. Finally the packaging, The plastic bag just rips very easily and is basically destroyed no matter how careful you are. This is a once and done purchase for me, never again from this company.",negative

"We eat a lot of nuts.  Heart healthy and tasty, what's not to like.  This large 2# bag of unsalted, non-GMO, chopped walnuts goes a long way with our family meals and snacks.Ingredients: Walnuts; allergen info: may contain peanuts a/o other tree nuts.  Our bag included a recipe for walnut banana bread- yummy.  They recommend, and we concur to store in freezer or refrigerator to keep them fresh tasting.  The expiration date on our bag was 12/15/17.Tasty and fresh, not rancid or old, store them well and enjoy.",positive
"Sadly, these grains did not work for me, and I've tried everything I can think of to try, and wasted a lot of milk. The grains have grown in number, but I still don't have kefir. When I contacted the seller, he said that if they're growing, then they're fermenting the milk, and not to expect store-bought thick kefir. I don't, but I do at least want some thickening and kefir to drink. All mine does is get a few curds at the top around the grains, but underneath is just regular milk. I sent him a video of mine but didn't hear back. Unpleasant smell and taste, also, when I decided to try and drink some.It's a completely different experience from kefir-making I've done in the past, so it's possible these grains just aren't my cup of tea. I got spoiled having thick, creamy, delicious homemade kefir and will go back to that merchant for grains.",negative
My favorite is the dark chocolate w/goji  raspberry. Buying the larger package is a better bargain than buying the small bags from the grocery stores.,positive
Taste so much better than many other brands I tried. I only like chocolate. Not as much protein as other brands but taste is so much better.,positive
"This water has definitely worked wonders for me with my acid reflux. My only warning is that the PH level is rather high, so you have to gradually work up to it. I was getting really nauseous as I was drinking this water like I did normal Ice Mountain Spring Water (4-8 bottles a day). Come to find out, you have to gradually introduce yourself to a PH level that is that high. So I recommend alternating with Spring water or mixing it with spring water. Regardless, this is great water. I haven't been able to afford massive bottles in order to see if it does truly help with weight loss, but it has helped with my acid reflux. PH diet is the way to go and I do truly believe that higher levels of acidity in the body contribute to many ailments--balance with alkaline!",positive
"great tea,  quick delivery",positive
Do not buy these b/c I got them at walmart and the coffee ones at walmart.com when they were back in stock for under 3 bucks for each bag. And the flavors aren't anything to brag about. My coffee ones didn't taste strong like coffee at all and one even had a butter taste. The honey ones are just sweeter without any honey flavor. The chili wills will only give you spice at the back of your throat and gave me heartburn. The bags are the standard size of baking chocolate chips and each serving is only one little 1/4 cup. Don't be fooled If you want to try them get them cheaper somewhere else. I agree to the reviews under the questions section.,negative
Great for my hiking/camping adventures!,positive
Satisfy the tamarind taste,positive
"I’ve ordered these for my mother 5 times now, she said the 5th time she received them, all the bottles were flat. I am very disappointed by that, especially considering how I pay for them, the price is obviously more expensive than normal. I’ve decided I will not be ordering anymore, it’s not worth the cost if the sodas might be flat/expired by the time she gets them.",negative

Kids adored these! Will buy again!,positive
"The first time I tried this coffee, I was disappointed with the flavor because it seemed far too faint. However, the more my wife and I drink it, the better it seems to get to the point where it is now our favorite for a late night decaf option.  Sometimes your first reaction is not always the best and that is true for this coffee review.",positive
These are delicious! I was pleasantly surprised they came and were not smashed up by other items in the box.,positive
"Better than the “real” deal. Exceeded my expectations by far, had these in California  I can’t wait for these to be sold in local grocery stores as I cannot find them anywhere in my area (DC). For now it seems I have to settle with Amazon but I’m so addicted, it’s hard to not eat all four bags at once!!!! Although if I do I just say I’m eating them for health, hey they have protein right? #vegan gains",positive
Never used this stuff! But it's very potent!,positive
"Unfortunately DEFECTIVE ! Made it according to package directions, but we were shocked that it had ultra pungent ""urine"" odor.  Naturally we did not give it to the family; but threw it away.

We purchased a box of 6 based on previous Mountain House delicious purchases, but returning ALL of these asap.",negative
"This soy milk powder tastes and smells bad. I tried to make soy milk out of it and it's undrinkable the flavor is so pungent not like other soy milk products that I bought. It's not a beanie flavor, it just tastes funky. Unfortunately I didn't open it until after the return date was closed so I'm stuck with it I'm going to put it in my compost since there's nothing else I can do with it.",negative
"This was my first time purchasing Maude’s coffee.  I don’t normally drink decaf.  The only time I do is when I have an early presentation to give and don’t want caffeine adding to the pre-presentation nervousness.I was pleasantly surprised.

"Wow!  I am on a low carb diet and miss chocolate more than anything.  I am not a huge fan of dark chocolate, so I was finding it difficult to enjoy anything ""chocolatey"" for an occasional treat.  This is the BOMB for low carb milk chocolate.  It is smooth as silk and oh so creamy.  It has almost no aftertaste.  I am now one happy low carb girl.",positive
Great variety and super awesome quality!,positive

"So I’ve tried about every single Keto snack  out there, and these cookies are the real deal . I’ve been buying ALDIs brand and Highkey cookies for years and these cookies blow them out the water . The texture is so nice , it’s nice and soft and doesn’t immediately fall apart like most keto cookies . The Macros are insane 10 grams of protein and only one carb it’s insane. I’d buy these even if I wasn’t on keto . I don’t have one bad thing to say about this amazing company",positive

The bag was opened and damaged! There were also a few open wrappers inside the packaging. I’m pretty sure someone ate a few before they got to me!,negative
"I love this coffee. It's a concentrate that you mix with water and heat. It's meant to be used in special machines, but I just mix it myself. I freeze in small amounts and thaw out one batch each week and use it until gone. (I have to thaw the whole box to start with in order to divide it into smaller amounts.) It's important to shake it well at each step of the way.This came as two boxes which came quickly and well wrapped. They were in a cooler with dry ice and were still frozen.",positive
"I was skeptical at first because of the high cost, but I was having company over and using a recipe in which the pasta itself was the standout ingredient, so I took the chance on this brand.  This pasta was excellent!  Nutty, toothsome, full of flavor and with a great texture for holding sauce.  I’ve become very loyal to this brand, and purchase whenever I need a great pasta. I wouldn’t use it with a thick, hearty sauce that overpowers the pasta itself, but for more delicate, simple sauces it is perfect.",positive
They came melted. Total waste of money. No way to return.,negative

"The Yellow Curry paste is great for my family.  Yellow is less spicy than the Red and Green of this brand.  We use them all and love them all, but the yellow is my favorite.  Easy to use and keeps well in the fridge.  I order two at a time to save shipping.  Just saute some onions in oil, then stir in the paste and some fish sauce and sugar to taste.  Add broth and coconut milk then chicken and vegetables.  Easy great curry.",positive

If the benefits of drinking white tea is greater than drinking green tea, I'm definitely sold on this.  In fact, I just ordered a box which I will be giving to my brother and sister-in-law.",positive

"My wife and I ran out of cumin. Where we used to live, grocery stores had bulk aisles where you could buy lots of cumin for not lots of money. Here, the same amount sets you back close to the cost of a meal at a nice restaurant. Obviously, a solution was needed.I searched around and found two pounds of cumin on sale from Frontier. Prime shipping, no tax, why not? I clicked ""order"" and didn't think about it until I got home from a business trip and noticed two massive bags sitting on the kitchen table. I'm not sure exactly how much I thought I was buying, but two pounds of cumin is a lot. I'm pretty sure I won't need to be needing to buy cumin for the next two to three years. In fact, I might be able to sell some to my local grocer and supply them for the next two to three years as well.That said, the quality is fantastic. Lightly toasted and put through the spice grinder, and there is a noticeable improvement over generic supermarket cumin. The price and quality are both fantastic.All in all, this is a good way to go if you need some cumin - especially if you need a lot of cumin. Share some with your mother, grandmother, aunts, uncles, neighborhood watch society - whoever... you'll have plenty. But even if you keep it all for yourself, you'll be glad you ordered.",positive
I love this candy so it’s great to buy in bulk at a good price.,positive
"I always keep a bottle of this oil on hand.  It is delicious to smell, to begin with.  Whenever we have company over to dinner, I do my veggies in Macadamia oil (green beans, asparagus, you name it), and we get RAVE reviews, they want to know our secret, and there are never any leftovers of the vegetables.I also use this in any baked goods recipe for the oil portion of the ingredients because it is so good and has a higher smoke point than other common oils.Now if only I could find a way to turn this into a hand creme, because I love the smell so much.  This brand is more aromatic than other brands of macadamia oil that I have tried.  I keep coming back to this one again and again!",positive
Super tasty drink! The sparkling aspect makes it so refreshing! I’m going to attempt one of their mock tails next! 😋,positive
"I think I may have some weird grinder fetish.  I absolutely love the sound of the baby pepper grinder. It helps that I use this on absolutely everything. It has the perfect pepper garlic combo. Who needs ketchup,  mustard,  mayo,  etc., when you have this magnificent invention.",positive
"I thought I was getting a bargain when I bought this multi-pack, but it turns out the cookies are actually significantly SMALLER than the ones you get in the regular-sized Milano bags.

"This is great stuff. I really love the Harmony House products so far, and I am excited to order more. I LOVE tomatoes. I use them constantly, I grow them during the summer, I drink tomato juice every day, often multiple times. I love just about anything made with tomatoes. So this product intrigued me. My first thought was to order it so if I ran out of juice or sauce or anything tomato-based, I could use this as an alternative. I don't think I will ever go without this tomato powder in my kitchen again.Here are a few of the ways I enjoy using this powder:Tomato paste substitute ( 1 teaspoon powder + 1 ts water) Delicate tomato broth (1 ts to 1 cup of water)Mixed with the Harmony House veggie soup mix it creates a hearty veggie soup ( 5 ts powder, 2 cups water, 5 TB dried veggies)Sprinkle on an English muffin and top with cheese, makes a great mini pizza snackWhen I run out of my favorite tomato juice, this is more than an adequate substitute. (3-4 ts to 1 cup of water, or to taste)I love to sprinkle it over popcorn with a little butter and salt!I can't wait to try different ways to use this, and to add to my Harmony House stash. I think with some of the onion powder, celery, etc that this would make a great Bloody Mary! Also excited to add a little of this to my white wine based Ciopinno recipe!If you are considering buying this, go ahead and do it. It really aids in creativity in the kitchen! You will not be dissapointed!",positive
Very satisfied with the taste of this granola. Thank you!,positive
"I love this stuff. I think I feel like the white grape juice is a perfect combination so that the little bits of aloe taste like you’re literally just biting into little grape bits.

"The strawberry taste is the nastiest I have experienced.  It doesn't even taste like strawberry, but more like drinking chemicals.  Vanilla and chocolate tastes much better.  The boost also has too much sugar.  It defeats the purpose of a healthy drink.  The one with less sugar costs more, I don't know why or how when they will be spending less money if they add less sugar.  Doesn't make sense.  I guess it's because more people would prefer one with less sugar, so it's pricier even though it might cost less money to make.  Again, corporate profits.  They don't care about people's health.",negative
"These were some of the best, sweet cream was perfection and chocolate chips were fresh and the crust is buttery!",positive
"Oatfield Irish Butter Toffee certainly offers a value priced product. The taste was quite unpleasant. Just one bite of this confectioners ""delight"" was more than enough. Money wasted?

She provides care for the emotionally unstable and the mentally ill. I'm glad that someone enjoyed them.",negative
Good Evening Jocko and Echo. Love the tea. I now drink less coffee for sure. I brew the night before with 2 packs and 16oz of water in my shaker cup. Then place shaker cup in frig over night leaving tea bags in over night for total extraction of everything the tea bag has to offer.,positive

I don’t mind the fact that almost all of them are broken but they are stale.  When I tried to return them it says no returns.  That should have been in the ad.

"Both of my grandparents had sugar bushes in Vermont. In fact one of theirs (my maternal one in Stevens Mills) is still operating, now by cousins. So I grew up knowing the taste of the best, my paternal grandfather producing mostly ""fancy."" And what I get from Ferguson Farms (where they are I know not) is wonderful, not quite ""fancy"" as Gramp Selby's was but close enough. And here's something else you should know: they send the order immediately.",positive
"Will continue to buy them. Sweet, and seedless",positive
Works great especially since many fast food places are doing away with their lemon for iced teas.,positive
"Hershey Kisses never fail to make me happy. This batch was a good value. Out of the seven orders I've placed, this was the first to be discolored. They taste fine and I understand the whiteish film on each piece is harmless. I was just surprised. I think my orders have been with several suppliers.",positive
So much easier to use than liquid color stuff. Just a couple of drops brings out great color.,positive
"I have purchased the 8 pk several times.  Always fresh, great price and fast delivery. I will continue to buy from this company.",positive

Received these and tried two of them and they were horrible. Fish like smell and taste to them. We had had some by crazy cups before without This taste so i am not sure what is going on. Even the packaging was different than the normal crazy cups we have purchased. Picture attached to show the outside of the cups with how gross/scratched up the pods were. If you look at the picture posted for the item the pods are actually grooved and the ones we received were not.,negative

"This stuff was amazing! YOU TOO could become the Popcorn Master among your friends. Grab some mushroom-style popcorn, pop it in coconut oil, and immediately shake it with lots of this cheese powder in a large container with a tight lid. Seriously the best cheese corn you'll ever have, nothing in the stores will taste as good. Remember to share it....",positive
I will only eat organic apples and I was VERY impressed with these. I have ordered them numerous times and they are big juicy and absolutely delicious! REGARDING THE BRUISING some people have mentioned in their reviews. Occasionally one of these apples does show up with some very pale brown bruises (usually the size of a half dollar)  however they DO NOT ruin the apple! It's very easy to simply cut the bruised part off. Unless you want to display these apples on a coffee table they are perfectly wonderful and super sumptuous!I highly recommend them -- as well as their organic broccoli which is amazingly fresh and very purple hued.,positive
I love chick o sticks. They were fresh. Only thing is I thought I ordered the larger ones but I didn't.  I would buy again only larger size.,positive

"This popcorn pops so very well.  I use my hot air popper and then melt real butter to drizzle over the corn. Yes, real butter but 100 times more healthy than microwave popcorn. This will be my new go-to brand.  Probably the best popcorn I have ever used.",positive
Didn't know if I would like. Oh my I must say I love this. Will reorder.,positive
I used to eat this when Blovkbuster was around and they were always way to expensive for eo little. These however are worth the price since the price is equal to the amount you get which is alot in my opinion. I love Jordon almonds. Very nostalgic.,positive

Excellent assortment of fine tasting meats. The Wagu Beef was the best!,positive
"Avocado Oil is the best, and this is a great, delicious, lower-cost option. Our initial shipment of it was damaged during shipping so we did not receive it, but Chosen Foods were great about quickly sending us another shipment, which tons of protection to avoid breakage. Would love to be able to subscribe to this as we make our own mayo using it, and it's the best high-temperature cooking oil.",positive

"I wanted to love this.  I really did.  But even though the description says flash frozen, let’s face it.  It’s a frozen vegetable and it just loses its crisp fresh texture.  IWould not recommend.",negative
Not worth it. The crab isn't big enough to use in any dish.  When trying to drain off the juice you lose a lot of crab too because it's so tiny it goes through the small holes of a sieve.,negative

It has an awesome taste with just the right amount of heat,positive

"I absolutely love the tastes and aromas I can get from these tea bags.If I steep them in cold water, I get a lot of floral essences without much bitterness.If I steep them in boiling hot water, I get all of the bitterness of the hops with more pine flavor and very little floral essence!It's an American pale ale without the grain or alcohol.",positive
In no way are these cashews spicy. I think they're confusing spiciness with extremely excessive salt levels.,negative

DELICIOUS AND SO CONVENIENT!  I WOULD BUY AGAIN!,positive

"These Palouse brand beans are a taste of home - grown right up the road (well, about 50 miles) from where I was raised. I appreciate the Identity Preserved, Non-GMO policies, and was pleasantly surprised at the absolute consistency and cleanliness. I've washed my share of beans in 60 years, and there was NO dirt, NO crush, NO bad beans in either batch I've prepared so far.I'll be a repeat customer and will try other products from them. Very pleasantly surprised.",positive
"i remember getting these at our local restaurant cashier station when i was a child. the owner use to give them for free to kids who dined there with their parents. of coarse, after dinner! i went to a retro candy/soda store in burbank, and these were on the counter. just like when i was a kid. however, no longer free. i purchased a few. well, when i put it in my mouth, i went back 40 years. went to amazon in hopes of finding them. as usual, amazon carries everything. these are so yummy. even people who never had one, fall in love with the taste. so creamy and chocolaty. i will always have these on my coffee table. oh, also yummy when chilled in the fridge.",positive

"I bought this product because my boyfriend has ADHD and has a huge issue when it comes to sleep, even when the product doesn't work particularly with his problem, it relax us a little, I could take this in the office with out being sleepy just relaxed. The flavor is GOOD all the way, you don't have to add anything to make it better and the after flavor is the best, really refreshing.",positive

"Used for vanilla extract, beans are very fresh.",positive
"These are really great. I use Pyure sweetener so I was glad to see this cookie mix. They taste great! They are flat, but that's normal for flourless cookies. I hope they don't stop selling this mix. I want to try to brownie mix too.",positive
"I tried so many sea salt macadamia,like the one in Carpo London UK,but the taste of Carpo Macadamia the same.",positive
"All I can say is that this is the BEST out there that I have ever tried, and I am a meat connoisseur!  I sent some to my Dad randomly one day and he said he ate 2 bags in one sitting.  It is the tenderest, most flavorful jerky out there.  I wouldn't even call it jerky for that matter; it's like dried and marinated ribeye steak.  So worth the price, I can't express that enough.  This is nothing like the normal tough shoe leather jerky; if you like that, don't buy this; this is fall apart in your mouth tender.  I like all flavors in the 4 bag combo; the spicy ones are pretty spicy with certain bites, but not so much that you want to drown yourself in milk.  I hope this helped!",positive
"love wasa, usually pay $5 a pack. great price.",positive
"I love them.  Healthy, too!",positive
"Way, way too sweet!  How did I miss the crazy amount of added sugar when I ordered?  Stupid me...An entree really shouldn’t taste like a dessert.  Also too mild, should have more heat.  I’m lucky to live in a city with a very vibrant Chinese community, have had the pleasure of enjoying really good Chinese food.  This falls short.",negative
Very happy that these are gluten free.,positive
Awesome Product! It is just as tasty as it is convenient! Shipped quickly- will buy again!,positive

Love to smell it brewing and can't wait to enjoy it!,positive
"I ordered this product originally and it was 5 stars!!!!! could not get enough of the turkey sticks.  After gobbling my way through the first batch I reordered a second batch and was less than impressed.  The flavor seemed off and texture was different.  I mentioned this in a review and email to the supplier/ manufacturer and they jumped into immediate action and took care of the problem.  They reached out and sent me a replacement batch immediately.  They were EXTREMELY helpful and took care of the issue with lighting speed.  I will say the even the replacement batch was different from the original, but it was good and better than the second order.  Replacing the bad order and the outstanding level of customer service and follow-up that I experienced is what will keep me coming back and ordering from this company.  Overall great experience, and good product.",positive
Bought as a holiday gift for my husband seeing he works a night shift. He loved it! It's strong but not undrinkable gross,positive

1 packet per 8oz watre- thought it made more- a little misleading - it also has no flavor if made per directions,negative

It is a BBQ kind of taste but is as thick as water so you cannot cook anything in it,negative
This was a perfect cake topper for my daughter's cake. She also couldn't wait to play with the horses after the cake was gone. The item was as described and arrived well packaged. Would recommend this product and company to others.,positive

"Doesn't taste like Sumatra and after opening 2 different packs, the beans look different. Won't order this product through Amazon again.",negative
Totally delicious and no calories!  A perfect little party for your mouth.  Just be careful how many you eat because it contains a sugar that causes gas.,positive

"This clear vanilla extract is the best, ever! Once you have tried it, you will never go back to imitation! Just the scent alone makes your mouth water.

"For some reason our office has a Keurig brewer, but only gets Green Mountain French Roast and hot cocoa. I bought this to keep at my desk as a secret stash. It tastes great and saves me a lot of money over going to Caribou or Starbucks every morning.  Kona was one of my favorites from my last job where we had much more variety.  The only difference is that it was a different brand, but this one is as good or better.",positive
Not the best quality. Flavor OK but it was not chunk but broken up,negative
This hazelnut coffee is very artificial tasting while at the same time very watery and weak.  I normally get Gloria Jean sometimes Green Mountain Hazelnut. These pods don’t compare to either to me even though the description says they compare to Green Mountain. Maybe they are made at the same factory I don’t know but they sure don’t taste the same to me.,negative
"Amazing flavor, I used these as stocking stuffers and loved the appreciation of the uniqueness.",positive
Purchased for a gift.  Recipient loved it.,positive
It's not the best way to to make a fresh espresso drink. But it's extremely  convenient.  I love that my Delonghi EC155 is compatible  with these pods. I like to buy them direct  that's when they are the freshest but you can't beat the price here.,positive
"I purchased this from whole foods based on Amazon's great reviews, Unfortunately I should of paid more attention to the bad reviews and did further research.  For the last year or so I've tried my best to use only pure and natural products for healing, before I started using this honey I was well on my way and headed in the right direction to a better healthier me, but while taking this I was getting sick but continued to consume the honey in belief of its amazing healing powers, this honey ended up giving me toxic shock and was making me so sick that it became debilitating and I didn't realize it until after I finished the entire bottle, what a big disappointment and waste of money.",negative
"I use this in my chicken enchiladas and on nachos....THIS IS SO GOOD , It gives a smoky flavor - great for Mexican flare...The flavor kicks up many recipies ...Pairs well with crawfish etoufee also...has a great smokey flavor.

Ate them all they where that good gone to order more,positive
This juice is delicious and healthy. But the price is a total rip-off! $9.92 for 1 box of 10 pouches! That’s highway robbery!! I don’t care whose pic is on the pouches!,positive
"I switched over to a gluten-free lifestyle many months ago to alleviate some health problems, and it's been quite a challenge. My body feels healthier, more alive, and no more digestive issues- but buying gluten-free mixes and prepared items are really hit or miss. You could end up with something that tastes almost exactly like it's wheat flour equivalent, or you could end up with something rubbery or super grainy.I've been experimenting with making all my gluten-free items from scratch with my wide array of starches and flours, but I was suffering from a sweet craving and just did not feel like playing around with recipes to get something yummy. So, I bought this mix. I cannot believe how amazing it tastes! It tastes almost identical to regular chocolate chip cookies! It has a very *slight* grainy texture, but nothing worth complaining about. I love that they don't skimp out on the chocolate chips either! The chips are a bit harder, but It tastes the same as anything else. I'm not sure why another reviewer said they tastes rancid. He/she might have gotten a bad box?Very sweet, moist cookies. I recommend only eating one at a time due to the sugar content. Also, I find this easier to mix with your hands! It worked better than my electric hand beater.This contains soy, which might be an additional issue for people with food intolerance. The mix itself does not contain dairy, but the finished product will. I bet you can find a clever butter substitute that works with mixes like this,though!",positive
Expired item by 1-1/2 years.... What the Hell is up with this crap?...,negative
I had many bouts of diarrhea after I ate 5 pieces of sugar free taffy. May have been old candy; or I'm allergic . will not order again.,negative

Adds flavor.  It notes that its salt does not contain iodine.  You might want to sprinkle a little extra iodized salt on your popcorn.,positive
"I've watched this film about thirty years ago and it stuck in my mind until now. When I came across it on DVD, I didn't hesitate too long, even more, because I have a predilection for early Belmondo flicks. But what a bad surprise! Some movies should be allowed to resign from public exposure, to preserve a certain memory, and not to shock audiences.Widely hailed as one of Chabrol's rare cynic works, the only lasting impression I got from re- watching it is... boredom. Some movies really do not age in style. But what about movies which didn't have any sense of style at all?The flaws in the script, uninspired acting - presumably due to the lack of direction -, a sort of production design, which doesn't deserve its name, less than mediocre photography and, last but not least, the worst editing job I've seen in ages, make this one truly hard to stand.My impression was, that there was a bunch of people with too much money and equipment but obviously, no idea or any skills at all. It really comes as a surprise, that this one didn't abruptly end Chabrol's career. Don't blame it on the overall bad taste of the 70s, this one is crap in its own right and a worthy contender for the most useless waste of celluloid ever.",negative
Definitely value for money!,positive
"Tally HO![for all my Brit/UK friends], Great flavors herin...I've used this in Oatmeal, preparing hot cross buns, added to store bought mince-pies [aka mince-meat, but now, no suet...like no lard in tortilla's, c'mon America, bring back REAL flavors- and PORTION CONTROL, you fatties out there], as well as topping ice cream, gelato, and shortbread cookies, ANYONE can use this marvelous food, to enhance dozens, no, make that HUNDREDS of foods/dishes.

"According to an old story, a beggar comes to a village, carrying an empty pot. He fills the pot with water, drops a large stone in it, and starts cooking in the square.One of the villagers asks what he's doing, to which he replies that he is making ""stone soup"", which tastes wonderful, although it still needs a little ""something something"" to improve the taste. The villager (although rather stingy) doesn't mind parting with a few vegetables, so these get added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the beggar gives him the ""stone soup"" spiel once again. The villager gives him a little bit of celery to help out.As word gets around (like it does in small villages) more and more people walk by, each adding another ingredient. Finally, a delicious pot of stone soup is bubbling on the fire, and is more than enough to share with everyone.Now, back to our regular review:If Healthy ChoiceHad a voiceThis tasteless phonyMinestroneWould be begging to be put out of its miseryPotatoes, driedLurk insideAnd the puny pastaSpells disastaFor this unappetizing bowl of goopy stewI see dead peasAnd celeriesAnd other odd stuffBut not enoughTo give this soup a flavor that could be considered ""natural""I would suggestFor the bestThat it would be wiseTo economizeAnd try a stone instead of shelling out your hard earned bread for thisAmanda Richards, October 2, 2008",negative

"I place my first order of this item on June 26, 2020, but did not open it until July 4. The tea smelled stale, and I tried to return it - when I was asked the reason for return, I told the seller (Amazon.com) that the tea smelled stale, and asked about how to decipher Best Before/Lot # 0423-03S115. Nobody answered my question, but I was offered an option for Amazon to replace the same item for me. Because I really likes Numi Organic tea before, and I have always trusted amazon.com for providing high quality product, I chose to have Amazon send me another bag. The replacement bag of tea has the exactly same Lot#, and smelled and tasted stale and rancid too!!! I tried to return the item, but it was not an option anymore. I am very disappointed in Amazon, not just the money, but more about that I cannot trust Amazon anymore.",negative

I love death wish. As a mom of four with 2 jobs its my lifeline. The strength is perfectly strong with a smooth rich taste. I accidentally got the ground coffee (i prefer the beans) but they are amazing i would and do suggest them to everyone i know. I mean who wouldn't want death wish,positive

This sampler pack has quite a variety of flavors and I can't wait to try them all. I recently bought a new pot and pod coffee maker and was looking for a decent variety of coffees to offer guests. It took me a while to make a choice because I prefer strong coffee and most flavored coffees are too weak. My new machine enables me to choose a strength level that makes the offer stronger by adding less water.  It makes a smaller cup but I do get to enjoy more favors.,positive
"I bought this brand of olive oil because a friend uses it and had highly recommended it.

"As a senior citizen on a limited income, I ordered these frozen bialys on September 7… they did not arrive until September 20 and had completely defrosted. They were large and looked more like a bagel than bialys… stale with little onion flavor and rather tasteless. Tried two to be sure and was disappointed…do not recommend ordering. I love a good bialy but this was not one…just a complete waste of my limited resources… to be fair , it may have been the long journey but can’t afford to experiment.",negative

Try this on scrambled eggs!,positive
I could not be happier with this product. Coconut milk alone is too heavy and the strong coconut taste is too overpowering. Almond milk alone is too watery. The two together are combined perfectly in this product for creamy texture and taste. I enjoy it in coffee and tea. I use it every day. What makes me even happier is it is free of animal products. This product comes in other flavors but I have not tried them. It also comes in a refrigerated version. I find no taste difference between the shelf-stable version and the refrigerated version. The shelf-stable version suits me best because I travel often and I can take this with me. The containers are small enough not to have to waste much if refrigeration isn’t readily available.,positive
It had a taste like old dust! It did not work as well as Gatorade does.,negative
"Previous commentator Steve Richmond stated that A Walk On The Moon is, in his words ""not worth your $7"". I ended up paying a bit more than that to import what is one of the worst-quality DVDs I have yet seen, of this film or any film in existence. Even when you ignore the fact that the DVD is clearly sourced from an interlaced master and just plain nasty to watch in motion, the film has no redeeming qualities (save Anna's presence) to make watching a top quality Blu-Ray transfer worthwhile. Not that this is any fault of the other actors. Liev Schreiber, Diane Lane, Tovah Feldshuh, and Viggo Mortensen all score high on the relative to Anna Paquin acting ability chart. Far more so than Holly Hunter or Sam Neill did in spite of an equally lousy script, anyway. Director Tony Goldwyn's resume is nothing to crow about, but Pamela Gray's resume includes Wes Craven's most dramatic excursions outside of the horror or slasher genre, so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad direction.As I have indicated already, the sole reason I watched this film is Anna Paquin. In her acting debut, she literally acted veterans of the industry with a minimum of twelve years' experience above hers under the table. While she is not as far ahead of her castmates here, her performance as a girl that starts the piece as a brat and grows into a woman whose world is crashing down around her proves her Oscar was no fluke. For some time I have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel, and a dialogue seventy-three minutes into this film is yet another demonstration of why. This woman could literally act the paint off walls. Anna aside, only Liev Schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience. Sure, his character spends the vast majority of the film neglecting a wife with an existential crisis, but he plays the angered reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly. I should know, even if it is not from the same circumstances here.Viggo Mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman, although perhaps not to the same extent. In a manner of speaking, he is the villain of the piece, but he successfully gives the character a third dimension. Yes, his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded, but not many men would act any differently in his situation. Nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed-up situation, so Viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here. Unfortunately, these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a stagnant marriage where Tovah Feldshuh tells us that the Mills And Boon archetype of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exist. Either writer Pamela Gray or director Tony Goldwyn thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it. Anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks Diane who she is to be lecturing anyone about responsibility.That said, the film does have a couple of things besides Anna going for it. Mason Daring's original music, while not standing out in any way, gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not. Roger Ebert is right when he points out that while Liev is a great actor, putting him alongside Viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake. He is also very correct in that when the film lingers over scenes of Lane and Mortensen skinny-dipping or mounting one another under a waterfall, it loses focus from being a story of a transgression and becomes soft porn. The film seems terminally confused about the position of its story. No matter how many times I rewatch Liev's scenes, I cannot help but feel he has been shortchanged in the direction or editing. One does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful, but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long way.Ebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw Anna on the screen, he thought her character was where the real story lay. Stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen, to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as Earth-shattering as the moon landing will not help. In spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her character's story is presented, Anna might as well be walking around with a neon sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes. While I am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast, it is very much as if they did not bother to try with Lane and Schreiber. Fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere. Hopefully by now my ramblings about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrong.I gave A Walk On The Moon a three out of ten. Anna Paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances (and that is saying something).",negative

"Honestly, I feel terrible writing this review because I searched and searched for an alcohol-free, liquid vanilla in a larger amount and really wanted to LOVE this product!  I bought this product specifically because I live abroad and needed a larger bottle and they offer this in 16 and 32 ounces.This product is very thick and tastes very strongly of chemicals.  I could barely get any vanilla flavor from it - and it makes my icings and frostings taste horrid.  The propylene glycol (not safe) just makes the product taste terrible.  It's listed as the second to last ingredient - but really - it just takes over any vanilla in the bottle.  And it comes out like glue into the measuring spoon and sticks!  Really a disappointment.",negative

"I have grown tired of overly “Bold” dark roast coffee. Their is a current perception that coffee must be bitter to be “flavorful”.

An overall crowd pleaser.",positive

"Ever since it was proven to me without a doubt by the Curves computerized individualized workout program, this absolutely burned at least 100 more calories during a workout when used.  I worked at Curves and saw it happen for multiple folks so I started using it, why wouldn't I?  Curves has closed down but I am still active in other ways and find on those days I am dragging or if I know I have a big day ahead or a big trail to hike, whatever, I put these packets in my morning health shake.  It adds a nice orange flavor and gives me a sense of peace and wholeness.  While traveling I take them along to put in my water bottles. Sometimes I'll use only half a packet as it tastes plenty potent but I do love the flavor and always go back to the orange after trying the other flavor.",positive

It has a distinctive, satisfying taste that I appreciate most at the beginning of the day when I enjoy my breakfast latte.

"Watching Smother was perhaps the longest not-quite-90-minutes of my life. There wasn't a laugh to be had; in fact, I don't remember ever cracking a smile. Diane Keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoarder, the textbook overbearing mother character, a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder. She is manipulative, conniving, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic, and worst of all, boring.I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a long string of movie clichés--the dippy, socially inept distant relative who's just trying to break into ""The Industry"", the gruff and long-suffering but somehow still lovable father, the mild- mannered wife who just can't take it anymore (but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home), the herd of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew throw pillows while everyone is away, etc.God, what a snore. I've never been a Diane Keaton fan and Smother only reminded me why. Overacting is overacting, no matter how many pictures you did in your prime. Her attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating. What was the director thinking?While I like Dax Shepard and can even sometimes tolerate Liv Tyler, their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie. That was okay, because neither did I. Keaton's endless self-absorbed prattling was intolerable and at times Shepard's dislike for her seemed genuine. By the end of the movie I wanted to slap her myself.Awful.",negative

"I am a fan of black licorice. This was my first time trying the licorice beans. These reminded me of the Good N Plenty that I used to eat as a kid but they are much better. The candy shell is softer and the licorice is tastier. I had this bag devoured in 1 day. This is the ONLY downside. If you have a sweet tooth and lack of willpower then get one bag at a time.What brand/flavor is best in 100% opinion. I my opinion, of all the brands I have tried Wallaby is my favorite.",positive

At first they were great on every level from taste to price so I had this product on my subscribe and save.  But with the price hike, the latest boxes I received have been subpar.

Decided to try this out as a gift for my wife for X-mas. Let me say that it worked out great. She loved the wines and shipping only took a couple of days so it arrived perfectly on time. Only bad thing is that you have to be home for it to be delivered since it's booze and you have to provide proof of age. That was expected though and so doesn't rate removing a star.,positive
Made with toxic artificial flavors and dyes.,negative

"In an attempt to cash in on the success of Universal's horror films Majestic Pictures hired several popular actors from the current genre and put them in this effort that (realistically speaking) is nowhere near as good. With that, this is still worth everyone's time and it's a heck of a lot of fun to view and in my opinion it's better than most of what is supposed to pass nowadays as horror! Story takes place in the small German town of Klineschloss where the bodies have been piling up completely drained of blood and with suspicious puncture marks. Burgermister Gustave Schoen (Lionel Belmore) shouts ""It's Vampires"" but the local police chief Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas) thinks it's a madman who's responsible and he vows to catch him.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The Burgermeister and most of the towns folk think that the local kook Herman Glieb (Dwight Frye) who loves bats and frequently talks to them is the one they are looking for and they chase him until he falls to his death in a cave. The one who is responsible for the killings is Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who has created a new form of tissue mass that feeds on blood and he accomplishes this by having some sort of mind control over his servant Emil (Robert Frazer) who goes out at night to collect the blood. Dr. Otto has a pretty assistant named Ruth Bertin (Fay Wray) and an annoying aunt named Gussie (Maude Eburne) but they have no clue what he's up to but Karl eventually become suspicious when one of the murders takes place after Herman's death.Frank R. Strayer was never confused with being James Whale but he was a pretty competent director who ended up directing most of the ""Blondie"" films in that series and with this film he uses the same sets from ""The Old Dark House"" which was also filmed at Universal. I'm the first to admit that this film is downright clumsy at times but it's practically impossible to resist a film that has a cast like this including Frye who is pretty much doing his Renfield role only this time he befriends bats and strokes them and keeps them in his pocket for safe keeping! One thing that just doesn't make sense is the mind control that Dr. Otto has over Emil as the film never explains this and I had a strong sense that this was some sort of nod to ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" but on the other hand it's probably just the weakest part of the script. There are a few other tidbits that I noticed including the chase of Frye to the big caves which is obviously an early shot of the infamous Bronson Canyon where numerous other films have been made and also Wray's brown hair which is her true color. True horror film fans will appreciate this more than others but I think this is a fun film to view for everyone and with a cast as attractive as this it's well worth a look.",positive

I'll drink almost any coffee that someone brews for me, but this Capomo undrinkable. Perhaps its market is people who have never tasted coffee, but who have heard it referred to as ""mud"".I'm going to keep it around just to challenge visitors to drink it.",negative

Great seasoning. Authentic japanese flavour.Good value for money.,positive
either this or steel cut by Red Mill is eaten every morning.  Each has its taste advantage.,positive
Good price other than that I won’t buy it again.  So hard! About 90% hard only10% were nice and crunchy. Disappointed because I like this brand....,negative
I love this stuff. My household will never be without it. Everything from popcorn to enchiladas. Only complaint is I wish it weren't so salty.,positive
My stomach doesn't hurt from it.  I use it with black tea.  Doesn't take much.  It's very concentrated so don't drink it directly.  That would be very silly.,positive
These are the best milk chocolate covered almonds I’ve ever had. The almonds are crunchy and fresh. The milk chocolate is very good. My coworkers love them too!,positive
Oh yum - rhubarb. These links are fab. Thanks,positive
I bought this for my daughter. She loves anything tropical. I thought this mango and coconut tea would be perfect for her.  The smell and taste were so artificial and did not have any resemblance to coconut or mango. I will never buy again! So disappointed!,negative
"So yummy, filling, and guilt free pleasure! Who knew life could be and taste this good!",positive
"The best-before date on three of the four bags were for Feb 25, 2016.  That was a month before I received them.  One bag was for 2018.",negative
LOTS OF FLAVOR? WE LOVE IT.,positive
These are so good!  Can't find them anywhere else.,positive
"This is not real honey. It is sugar syrup mix. It has flavoring added, which ruins the flavor of the honey. It is also sold at more than twice the market price of honey.",negative
THEIR GREAT SNACKS...CAN EVEN FREEZE THEM AND EAT WITH COFFEE..WHO KNEW !!!  FAMILY LOVES THEM SO WE KEEP THEM IN STOCK.,positive
Best guacamole mix I have ever had. Can't find it in grocery stores for some reason. Will order it by the box off of Amazon. Delicious!,positive
"Seal on bag seems robust. I had purchased two smaller bags as I wasn't sure how quickly I would use the product, so keeping the product dry was important.",positive
Hydration! Thank you!,positive
Love that it doesn't have a horrible aftertaste like aspartame does !,positive
These were great for my Halloween treats.  I used them as eyes for Monsters Inc Oreo pops and mummy pretzels.  None of them were broken.  There was one extra black piece in my package but it did not come off of any of my eyeballs.,positive
"Love this oatmeal, I use it in my granola cereal mix, along with the rolled oats.  The Scottish is cut small and I love the consistency in my cereal.",positive
The mayo arrived Jan 12th. We stored it in our pantry until we were ready to use it. We were ready a few days ago and found the mayo looking like this. I thought shaking it might help but as you can see it did not. I bought the same mayo from the store and didn't have this problem. The return/refund date closed on the 12th unfortunately. :/,negative
"True authentic Colavita.Its always a concern of mine that I could get an oil that is a cheaper version of what I ordered. That being said, this one is legit!",positive
I never had this Christmas bread before and wanted to try it..wowNever will I eat a hard fruit cake again..This is my new favorite Christmas bread will buy again!,positive

Sorry didn’t like it. Arrived dry.,negative

Much better than any coffee I have tried,positive
Perfect combination to make enchilada sauce,positive
"Not taste good, and also will expire in a few month.",negative
"Great tasty home made boba! Definitely I recommend this, very fast and funny preparation, you really enjoy with friends or the kids. Much cheaper than buying outside, you get two bobas for the price of one if you buy outside.Get 6 bobas at home with this beautiful box and enjoy, they are so delicious, try it by tour self!!I love boba Party Kit❣️",positive
the only kind of Paprika my wife will use!!,positive
Gave as a gift he loved it.,positive
"Ordered whole bean and got medium ground coffee. Very disappointed.As for the product itself I can't say it's great. So far pour over is very melo with very faint caramel/chocolate notes.  It almost reminds me of drinking black tea.  Moka pot it's a bit better, I'll have to try it again since I think it was an under extraction. That being said I got a sour almost citrus flavor from the moka pot, but I think it was under extracted due to grind size.  The somewhat dull flavor might be due to the coffee being already ground, so a lot of the moisture is gone.I will not buy this again.  In no way can I say this reminds me of my times in the desert. For those of you out there maybe you'll have better luck with a drip machine, I don't own one so I have no say for those that try it that do.",negative
This product is delish. I wish they had more so I could buy them again.,positive
Perfect product wonderful biscuits,positive
"I've used this product a few times in my hair (dampen locks, rub in oil after liquefying in palm, add a few essential oils, scrunch, gently twist up and cover with bandana for a few hours before washing) and have had great results with my naturally curly hair.  I have found that my hair is softer, shinier, and definitely more manageable.  The only trick is being mindful to not be too indulgent with the oil.  I was pleasantly surprised when I used a curling iron to bend my curls to my will and realized that hair spray was unnecessary - the coconut oil residue enabled smooth and shiny sustainable curls on it's own.  Bonus, less products in my hair and cupboard!I've also found great success in smoothing this oil on my daughter's dry cracked eczema patches.  This product is a total win for our family.",positive
"I had never used this before. A friend asked me to make a birthday cake for her daughter using coconut flour. It came out nice, moist, good texture and flavor. I followed a simple recipe I found on line.",positive
I love the spiciness they have in the bitterness isn't so bad and well worth the benefits of getting your B-17,positive
"Less spicy than some of its competitors, this is a smooth coffee that tastes great any time of the year!",positive
Awesome productWood box presentation makes it ideal for a holiday gift .,positive
This is root beer with just a trace of ginger - not what I was looking for!,negative
"I thought there was something wrong with my microwave when I took this product out. The sauce was watery and the pasta was not cooked. I put the entree back in for another minute and nothing improved. The pasta is gummy, the sauce is pleasant, but too liquid, so I would not recommend this product to anyone.",negative
"Looks big in the picture, but actually it is small",positive
So delicious and very healthy for you as well!,positive
"I discovered these in a local Indian food market and love them. I paid 79 cents for them.  I think I will try some of the other flavors, but these are a winner for me.  I will buy them again, but I will also look around to see if I can get a better bargain.",positive
"I use this Maple Syrup for all sorts of things -- sweet potatoes, pancakes, waffles, smoothies, homemade creamer -- the list is never ending.  A great product with great flavor.",positive
This candy is amazingly beautiful & delicious. Right at delivery I was home and opened the bag to put in a lidded candy dish!!  The first piece I got was watermelon!!  What a surprise!!  I will order again.  It was sealed and fresh.  It was very nostalgic for me & reminded me of my childhood!!,positive
Love the taste. Great for drinks and cocktails.,positive
Doesn't get better!! This is my go to rub for all things bbq.,positive
"Love this Black Cherry Preserves!  As others have said, it is full of large cherries.  Delicious!",positive
Be sure to use it right away or freeze it because mine started showing mold after a couple of weeks in the fridge. It's full of flavor and hearty. Goes great with prego chunky pasta sauce,positive
"Not as sweet, as I would have liked, but worked for the proposed project. Yummy too.",positive
These are the best potato chips out there.,positive
I love tea with cardamom- aroma and taste absolutely wonderful! Good price! Great quality!,positive
"Tried this cracker seasoning mix for the first time, after learning that Savory Seasoning Mix has MSG in it. Very good and has a nice sweet flavor with a kick! I use the mini Saltine Crackers when I prepare this snack.",positive
"Whole package has mildew or mold upon arrival. Smells strongly of low tide, in a bad bad way. It's clear that the dulse was not fully or properly dried before packaging. Im afraid to use any of it since at least 2/3 of the package has growth. Very unfortunate as I was looking forward to trying incorporating seaweed into my family's diet",negative
Product came damaged and opened.,negative
The taste challenge was crazy. The flavors tasted just as the description.,positive
"Unbelievable scent; this turns heads and provokes comments as you walk to your desk and sit down to let this steep. Powerful, spicy cinnamon aroma and flavor. Very bold. It's like melting a bunch of Red Hots into a fiery brew then sipping and savoring.",positive
Great addition to marinate meats.,positive
I absolutely love this product worked instantly! Thank you!!,positive
"Good quality meat but not really my thing since I like the slab jerky soooo much better. The texture did not have enough chew for me, it did not have the fresh meat flavor that the slab jerky does. It had too wet and greasy of a texture. Not bad-- just not my preference. Too WET for me.",negative
Favorite flavor of haribo gummi bears,positive
I like white bread I used in sandwiches. Sad to say I was told by doctors to give it up.😩 (My age) That saddened me but I did. 🥺,positive
Nasty nasty nasty the worst thing I ever had do not buy,negative
"Bought two 2.2lbs bags of mixed Sperlari candies fully aware that there would be a disparity of flavors. This is acceptable, but both bags weighed heavily w/ coffee, licorice, and club. Coffee pieces accounted for approx. 38% overall w/ Licorice (13%) and Club (10%) - that's three flavors making up nearly 61%. Few or very few (comparatively) of the other flavors - especially the ultra popular Orange and Lemon w/ Alpine the least in both bags (save for the tiny Caramelline).  I've bought from Dulcefina a few times before and they were great, so somewhat disappointed. I fear a third 2.2lbs mixed bag would be no different.",negative
"These coconut bars are delicious, so glad I found them!",positive
"I was concerned when so many reviews said it took forever to cook. Maybe they got a bad batch? I soaked it for 15 mins and rinsed and it was fully cooked in about 40 mins, which is normal for brown  rice. Tastes great ,  turned out fluffy.",positive
That's where I started my 2 weeks in Costa Rica.  Breakfast...with Lizano.  Lunch at the bus station in Quepos...Lizano.Love it.,positive
Bought these as a stocking stuffer for my son. He is thoroughly pleased with the variety of flavors and has enjoyed the taste of them all! He is quickly becoming a hot chocolate addict; I definitely plan on ordering from this company again.,positive
My hubbyuses this drink mix at work its great. He work outside in this Florida heat it brutal.,positive
"Tastes great. I am not a coffee lover, but I enjoy this with a little cream?",positive
Amazing and delicious! Only the best stuff comes from Israel and this is no exception! Love it love it,positive
"Quick delivery, arrived as expected. My only complaint being the high price, but this is a wonderful product, so I can understand the reason for the price.",positive
I was looking for a particular old blendThat use to be the Tetley standard - excellent flavor...almost veering toward Earl Grey in fragrance...Amazon please ask Tetley to bring to the USA what only the Irish would approve of!,negative
This was such a great find.  The real juice is not over powering but enough to quench thirst.  Very good.  Last shipment arrived with carton ripped up.  not sure what happened,positive
"Very good product but for the amount,it was expensive",positive
Please look at the size of the box. I didn’t pay attention to it and thought it was bigger,negative
These sprinkles work great to bake with at my Deli!,positive
I love the flavor but these were all broken-hardly any whole ones-I used them in soup!,negative
For hair care. Did not know product was for cooking,negative
Got the product but came in different packaging then shown! Came in a white box all loose,positive
"This rub is wonderful on all bbq, especially ribs and chicken.  The color on ribs is a nice deep mahogany color.  Check out Malcom's Killer Hogs site as the price for 5 lbs is about twice what a 1 lb shaker is on here.  Shipping is reasonable too.",positive
"This is absolutely the best coffee.  You don't need much to brew the perfect pot, and therefore a can of Cafe' Du Monde' goes a long way and is more than worth the price.  Its flavorful, robust, rich, and satisfying without bitterness.  Even half-day old in the pot, rewarmed, is darn good.  I have found my coffee, and have no plans to switch.",positive
"Other than the chocolate chipotle mole (which is one of the grossest things I have ever tasted), this is all really yummy! I've bought this pack twice and I just throw away the gross one.",positive
Unfortunately we’ve opened and eaten four bags all are stale! And kinda hard...never had this problem before. Looked and they expire next month July 2020 kinda disappointing,negative
"I have been using these melba toast-like cookies as part of a weight loss diet for some time.  This is one of my favorite flavors, and this batch is fresh and crisp.  I will have to scold Amazon about the packaging and handing, because the latest batch arrived with a lot of breakage, but the product is very good.",positive
I made the muffins as instructed on the box but I remembered using more water and more oil before. Sure enough if you compare the box versus the single package you see the instructions don’t match. There goes money wasted. Please update the single packages to match the box instructions so your customers don’t suffer.,negative
"Omg, I'm such an idiot. I thought I was getting 72 items not 12. Fml. I didn't see the $20 shipping either. Omg. This is such a scam!!!! $75 for $6 value. Please don't fall for this.",negative
These were hard and stale.  They either sent a bad bag or a really old one.  Very disappointing and a waste of money.,negative
I'm In love with the COCO😍😍❤🔥💯 My kids and I use one every single day ABSORBS GREAT NO GREASY FEELING LEFT ON SKIN . SMELLS SOOOO GOOD🍫🍫. Will definitely be ordering more soon,positive
The taste and texture are amazing. A great snack.,positive
"My mom travels the world and brought these back in a metal tin that looks like a milk canister with a slit for a coin bank.  It was a very cute idea by their marketing team in Germany.  The candy is sweet, slightly crunchy (when chilled) and then creamy goodness at the end.  I have to say this is one of my favorite candies but a very sweet treat, to have once in a while.  Found these on Amazon but they were out of stock until recently.  I ordered them right away.  Price is a little steep but it's worth the shipping to have once in a while.",positive
Great product. Much cheaper at Costco.,positive
I purchased this and after using it realized one of it's ingredients is bacon!!!  Why does ranch dressing have bacon?Definitely not vegetarian friendly.Also has weird consistency.,negative
THIS IS A TOTALLY FLAVORLESS PRODUCT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. AND ONCE YOU BUY IT YOU ARE STUCK WITH IT...NO RETURNS. INTO THE TRASH IT GOES.,negative
This turned my dinner into a culinary feast. The shrimp cocktail sauce brought my appetizer to a new level. The horseradish sauce was the perfect compliment to the roast beef. Compliments start to finish !!!,positive
I find the taste of Organic Tomato Ketchup so much better than regular ketchup.  I like the small containers because they are a good size for trips in the camper.,positive
"Excellent quality, smooth tasting guarana. I don't even need to mix it with juice; it's pleasant just mixed with hot water and drunk as a tea. I wouldn't follow the ""teaspoon"" directions: a teaspoon is going to be 3-4 grams, not 2g.Personally, I'm a caffeine lightweight, so about 1.5-1.6g is perfect for me. There's no measuring implement provided, so I'd recommend using a milligram scale until you get used to an appropriate scoop size.Overall, guarana is much easier on my system than coffee (albeit harsher than maté). I'm happy with this purchase, and i very much recommend it over the ""standardized to 22% caffeine"" varieties, which are (more caffeinated but) terrible.",positive
"The Allegro coffee beans package delivered on Jan 7, 2021 has a Best if used by 11/11/2020. After a string of problems with the coffee bean packages delivered by Amazon, I have decided not to purchase more coffee through AMAZON.",negative

"Adds a nice peanut butter flavor to my protein shakes, with less than half the calories of what I would take in with regular peanut butter. This product will be added to my subscribe and save.One note, you do have to mix this in well, as sometimes I end up with chunks in my shakes, but they still taste good!",positive
Love the peanut butter crackers with my cocoa in the morning,positive
"Awesome on toast. A 10 on a bagel. Unique flavor and color, the taste is amazing. The company has the product delivered 1-2 days faster than reported. Makes paying for shipment worth it. I got a free gift the last two orders. This is my favorite spread for PB&J but ordering thru Amazon was easy and quick. Buy some now! Your mouth will thank you!",positive
"I am learning how to make cocktails, and this syrup is terrific in a Mai Tai.  It has such a nice flavor that I will also use it in place of amaretto in my holiday dessert trifle.",positive
Love this famous soup,positive
Container itself was damaged when I opened the box. It was hard to open due to the dent. Not sure how it could have not be seen before putting it in the box. I basically paid full price for damaged goods.,negative
Variety is nice. It keeps it from getting boring. I love the fact that these are all natural.They stay soft and tasty for a long time due to the reseal-able bags.,positive
Great product!  This is a game changer for low carb diets. You wont regret this purchase.,positive
It’s so packed full of nasty chemicals. Avoid this drink for sure.,negative
"I've used Rodelle Prime  Rib Seasoning for years. It's not only great on prime rib, but as a steak seasoning, on burgers and pork roast.",positive
"So happy that this has more protein than typical peanut butter.  I'm addicted and use it for many of my meals:  on waffles, on pancakes, in desserts, in sludges, in a wrap, and of course the classic pb sandwich.  The birthday cake flavor adds a sweet touch.",positive
"This was a great gift, not just candy, Full to the rim!!!",positive
"Although this set was cute, there was no way I was using it on my daughters cake. It reeked of chemicals of some sort. It wasn’t a light scent either. It was like opening up bleach but the scent instantly burning your nostrils. I do not recommend this set at all.",negative
like taste energy great and flavor out of this world.,positive
The dressing is sweet but not over the top. Great tasting!!!,positive
"First the taste - right out the package, it's the very very tart, and the passionfruit flavor was very faint.Second the consistentcy - again right out the package, it's a soft paste. It was easy to slice, and works well for baking in pastries, which is why I gave this 2 stars.Third the price - very expensive for the amount you get. It's like paying $12 for an applesauce cup. I will not repurchasing.",negative
I'm only writing a review because i saw many negative reviews saying it was not very sturdy.  i weigh 200 lbs and when i was assembling it i was able to stand on the bottom shelf no problem.  whoever said it was capable of only 25lbs per shelf is an idiot.,positive
Stale every time. Smells like rancid oil.,negative
This stuff is great for any cut of steak.,positive
Attention! These are not original they are knock offs do not purchase see these say European however the boxes are written in Chinese. Do NOT Purchase these are not original !,negative
Best pepper in the world,positive

This is the 2nd 5 pound bag I bought this year and the package arrived different even though it came from the same seller.  The first 5 pound bag tasted just like black scottie dogs should taste like (good).  I just received another 5 pound bag that came in a clear zip log bag instead of the sealed silver package the 1st bag game in.  This bag just doesn't taste like the 1st.  Not sure if they changed the way they make these or not.  Will not order again from this seller.,negative
This drink is so good! Its refreshing and not overly sweet!,positive
"This salt is excellent.  I haven't had time to use it much yet, as I bought it before I run out of my previous salt.  But so far, it is very good and I recommend it!",positive
"Bragg's is 110% of awesomness!  Sprinkle the tasty seasoning on anything - asparagus, meats, fish, veggies, tomatoes - anything!  Great seasoning.  Not salty at all.",positive
"I read some reviews of these that said they had really tough leaves, but I've eaten 6 can, and had nothing like that. Only a great experience. Good stuff!",positive
I love that they are individually wrapped so you can eat as many or as few as you want without the other cookies getting stale...,positive

These are now my favorite.,positive
These are a great size for a party,positive
Excellent taste it is light and perfect for a breakfast coffee for someone like myself that does not like a dark roast.,positive
I love the taste of this rice. I have a rice cooker that automatically cooks Brown Rice. I add a spoon of Cream of Chicken Soup and diced raw chicken. The cooker cooks it all.Great post workout meal when I include broccoli.My Rice Cooker takes 90 minutes to cook this to perfection. Then switches to a keep warm setting.I would prefer a girlfriend to cook for me. But Life Happens. . .,positive
"literally perfection! the problem was that I basically devoured them, because the chocolate was rich and creamy while the wafer was crispy yet so light.",positive
"I've been wanting to try cashew butter for sometime, and I'm so glad this is the one I picked to try first.  It is sooooo delicious.  It has such a unique flavor to it, I think it's really must be the cardamom that takes this over the top making it so awesome.  I really just want to sit with my spoon and eat it all in one sitting.  I will be purchasing this brand again!",positive
Delish! I love this flavor,positive
We have a Japanese Student living with us and when we ran out of our sauce that we brought back from Japan we ordered this one. It meets her approval and was great on the Japaneses pancakes she makes.,positive
There is nothing like smucker's walnut topping on vanilla ice cream! Simply the best flavor of all.,positive
Product is not like what's advertised.,negative
I have been using this product for years and it became scarce in the stores. It stays well!! I am still very pleased with this product!!,positive
"Enjoying this drink.  Will order, again.",positive
"Simply, I enjoy drink this water.",positive
"My wife bought a four-pack of Shibui sauce and I fell in love with her all over again. This stuff is just amazing. I put it on everything: Shrimp, rice, shrimp and rice, crackers, tortilla chips...I even put it on spaghetti tonight at dinner. It has some kick but is not overly spicy. (I know that's not very helpful without some sort of scale. I'd say it's spicier than Del Taco's mild sauce, but less spicy than Del Infierno sauce. Or, more appropriately, spicier [and less sweet] than McDonald's sweet chili dipping sauce.)If you like blazingly hot condiments, try the ""Uber Hot"" version. It burns like the fires of Hell but it's so delicious I can't stop!",positive
Out of 40 ..only 5 were of chocalate flavor rest all were strawberry…not good,negative
"I’ve  only purchased vanilla beans twice before, both times Madagascar beans. But the others were grade B and better quality (longer, thicker, and more fragrant) than these grade A, more expensive beans.",negative
Nice biscuits,positive
This is the perfect amount for one person to enjoy and avoid feeling gluttonous when you finished the regular bag because you didn’t want to “waste“ it.,positive
The flavor is bold if you are a garlic lover then this product is for you.,positive
I love Zevia. This is a great flavor.,positive
"If you have to choose between regular tea dust bags vs these silk sachet whole leaf tea, always these...always. I have a box of twinnings regular tea bags and the comparison is noticeable. A strong steeping tea bag with great flavor",positive
Multiple use of product,positive
I buy these as an incentive for my students. They love them and I love their enthusiasm for class work.,positive
Tastes great and was fresh. Received exactly what I ordered.,positive
This is perfect both hot and cold. The flavor isn't too sweet and taste just like the one they serve at most Boba shops.,positive
"Sorry I couldn't disagree more ,with the last comments . frankly I thought this was worse than Carry on Columbus , enough said . Last film for THE usually brilliant Charles Hartrey who looked out of place as the humour had move on to the Highly witty level of on the buses, films of which were being made at the same time ,were frankly funnier .Barbara Windsor was embarrassing,a character like one of your mums flirty friends who still thinks she's eighteen , on holiday with some non entity of a Scotsman , Rab c Nesbit he ain't. The series miraculously trundled on with duffers like Carry on Behind ,and Carry on England . Carry on Dick wasn't bad , but really with this film the end of the series was nigh , a pity because up to this film I cant think of bad film before this?",negative
They are spicy and good,positive
My husband received these for Christmas when he was little.  Making memories!,positive
I love these. I can eat them plain or with cream cheese. Not only gluten free but also on food that doesn't have soy either!!! They are sometimes hard to find and right now on back order but found them at Sprouts too.,positive
Delicious full of flavor bears.,positive
"I must admit that I don't know what ""warmth"" refers to, but the salami was delicious. Sometimes it can be a little on the old side so that the wrapping doesn't come off easily, but this one was just right. IMHO, it's also not nearly as good if it's too soft or too squeezable, but this salami was terrific.",positive
This was just green powder that smelled like tea.  DO NOT BUY THIS!,negative
"Why did they not follow the book ... I am really sad and disappointed. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, however, if you have read the book (maybe recently) it might be very difficult to remain objective. My wife had not read the book, and she loved the movie.Reasons for the disappointment are: 1) Cern's involvement ... gone with the wind, such a shame, there is a very small part at the start, where the antimatter is created, but even that does not stick to the facts (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, which is how Langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the Movie_ 2) Story-line between the (deceased) pope and Camerlegno completely gone ... this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3) Story-line between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra completely non-existentAll-in-all, too flaky storyline, and cannot understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name against it. Maybe I should revisit this film in 10 years time, when I cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book I am afraid)Really sorry for the negative review, which was spoilt by expectations",negative
One of my favorite flavors!! :D so fresh and crisp,positive
Lavazza coffee is delicious!,positive
Substitutes perfectly for sugar. Will use in all my baking for a healthier final product!!,positive
"Picked up a Taco Bell Taco Kit at the local mainline grocery. We get these a lot, cause we really like them a lot...however they were smashed to bits...we had already started the hamburger, so it was too late to change plans...not wanting taco salad, we had to run out last second for taco shells. Then, we found out they were recalled for being made with genetically engineered corn not approved for human consumption, so we were, in a sense grateful. Old El Paso from now on.",negative
"Great flavors, I will buy again",positive
"This was refreshing and tasty,I love coconut water and this real deal,no added sugars and it's straight coconut water,loved it!",positive
"I don’t know what Amazon did. These were great when I first started my subscription a year ago. Now, they sit for a week or so in the bag (which has changed since I first started my subscription) and they taste like plastic. Idk what the hell they did to the packaging, but I will not be buying ever again. This package is supposedly good until January of 2022. I guess if you like the taste of plastic you can eat it then, but not me. This is going on the trash today.",negative
"What a great deal as an add-on item! Tasty as always!  Need I say more, Theodore?",positive
Love the convenience of the single serve packages.,positive
Great product and easy to take to work,positive

Usually don’t like anything on my  steak but was introduced to this 4 years ago and love it!  Just enough flavor for steak as it rests. Bit pricey but can’t live without it. Ordered online because local store closed due to pandemic,positive
I love dill and this gave my a good supply for a long time,positive
Great tasting water. Will update if I see body changes in 2 weeks.,positive
"Sent this box to my mother for her birthday (91st). She was so delighted. Said the package was beautiful. Every item individually wrapped, which will give her time to eat without going stale. I was unable to see the gift. I take her word for it being beautiful and tasty.I will definitely order again.",positive

Delish!! Can't find this flavor in the stores so I like to stock up every so often online,positive
Its grate…goes well with the description,positive
"The item appears to be old, as the chocolate is grey in color rather than dark brown. Additionally most of the se salt has fallen off the individual pieces.",negative
"I drink LOTS - TONS of water, but after a while you do want a change.  I am not a soda drinker or sport drinker.  I watch my sugar intake and this was a game changer.  It gives your water flavor, even a sweet flavor, and it works amazing with ice water.  I drink this EVERY day and I love the addition to my water and yet, NOTHING in calories or sugar.",positive
"Tastes like medicine, inedible to me. Not nearly as good as the regular stuff.",negative
"While it doesn't taste like sweet honey, it is sweet and mixed with Matcha tea has great health benefits. We have used it for years.",positive
"This product is amazing! I've tried hundreds of non-sugar sweeteners all of which I always found to have a weird after taste or leave a weird film in my glass. I stubbed upon this and figured why not? This stuff is amazing just sweet enough and no weird after taste. I found it to be a great replacement in my coffee, oatmeal, and even when cooking. Will be buying again and again.",positive
My order arrived when I was told it would.  The product is amazing.  I have not cooked with it yet but use it in my coffee every morning and it taste just like sugar.  I couldn't be happier.,positive
"Have not used product yet. This was a gift for some one. However, at this time the product and quality appears what I wanted. I would have liked the option for a circular piece",positive
"Awesome bars, yummy",positive
"Very weak tea flavor and even weaker raspberry flavor, even when using TWO bags to the glass. The Celestial Seasonings Raspberry Black Tea K-cups were WAAAAY better!",negative
I’m a big red Swedish fish fan. These are from Spain and have great flavor and texture. I miss the old school Malaco red fish- and these are really close. I finished whole bag in 5 days and then immediately  bought another. Don’t judge me Babycakes.,positive
"If you are a fan of Indian instant noodles (Maggi!) and looking for something similarly spicy and flavorful, this one is for you. It comes with packages of powdered flavoring as well as liquid ones so it is slightly more work than Maggi but completely worth it. I prefer to go easy on the oil package because I don't like my noodles too oily. I really enjoy these - plain or dressed up with vegetables. From all my online research they seem to be vegetarian so I keep reordering them and you probably will too.",positive
"I love wasabi peas, but this brand is terrible! I would not give this to my worst enemy... save the money and get better ones",negative
These are delicious! I’m hooked!,positive
I have always loved these cookies!  Especially with my coffee as a treat!  They are deliciously simple.  Not too sweet!  And the price is very good.,positive
I ordered these because my fiancé said they are his families tradition. I didn’t realize they were coming from London!! They did not disappoint. The blending of orange and chocolate are a delicious blend!!! They’ve definitely done their homework! Loved them!!!,positive
Great product.  Quick shipment.  Thanks!,positive
This has been my favorite drink. About to order more ❤️❤️❤️❤️,positive
"We love this for flavoring sodas and steamers (steamed, frothed milk) and were so glad to find this package at a good price. My diabetic son loves the raspberry flavor and it's great we could get the sugar free. I also really like that these bottles are plastic, not glass. They are lighter and I don't worry about them getting knocked over and broken. Great product at a great price!",positive
I live in Israel half time and my only complaint is the price is high here but so far your product is the best I’ve found. Keep up the good work but try lowering the price a bit so more people can experience your great product!!!!,positive
Awesome flavor. LOVE it,positive
"I could barely swallow my first bite; sorry. It was awful. Texture, taste and after taste. All I can taste is sage sage sage. I had high hopes.",negative
"This is a great product for me because I struggle with eating enough protein, so being able to have a boost with this to help instigate my muscle growth really helps!! Good price and so worth it!",positive
"I love these cookies and was so excited to find them on Amazon. When they arrived, the chocolate outer skin had clearly melted and now looks all flaky.  Maybe just a bad transit from their warehouse.  Cookies edible, they just look awful.",negative
"I was used to regular rolled oats but was attracted to other reviewer’s comments about nutty texture and taste.  Very true.  I really like the firmness of this oatmeal which is very filling.  My portion size has gone down from what I usually ate with the rolled oats.  It does take longer to make, so I’ve been making larger batches that I keep in the fridge for several days of breakfasts.  I love adding in nuts, pumpkin seeds, yogurt, and sometimes maple syrup.  Very satisfying meal.  Heartily recommended!",positive
Boxes arrived damaged with a sticker placed over the manufacturer expiration date.,negative
Super lemon ah feeling nostalgic :) They came out with new flavors but super lemon is still the best!,positive
These Kefir grains are amazing.  It cultures quickly and within 3 days I was making delicious kefir.  The grains are shipped alive and not dehydrated so that was a huge plus.  I had to throw away some grains just with a week's worth of cultures.  Much thanks.,positive
love them. good flavor and good for the tummy.,positive
Ritz crackers used to be the go to cracker. You could actually use them to scoop some peanut butter and they were relatively strong. Now they’re paper thin even handling them lightly they break apart I don’t even buy them anymore!!,negative
Good taste. Works well in my breakfast shakes.,positive
"Came open, partially solidified and disgusting",negative
Best tasting fiber one,positive
I love this coffee as I prefer a mild light taste. The innovative cup holding device is great as well. This has become my brand of choice.,positive
"This product, when prepared exactly according to instructions, is very poor quality.  Looks absolutely nothing like the photos.  Noodles were broken into tiny pieces.  Zero flavor of any kind.  The broth tasted slightly herbal, but like it had been highly diluted.  I wouldn’t eat this for free, much less the outrageous premium price point.  And remember, it is non-returnable, so they gotcha!",negative
My favorite jelly beans growing up,positive
"When I smoke my cigarettes, I must have something to drink while I smoke.  I place 2 tablespoons of powder Stevia and pour 1/2 gallon of distilled water into a glass decanter and/or container and add 5 of these tea bags into the water with the ends of the tea bags hanging off the side.  I put on the lid and place the container inside the fridge.  It's done ""brewing"" in about 5 hours. No boiling required.  This is better than soda and fruit juices when you want to drink something that's sweet throughout the day.  I drink between 20 - 40 oz. daily along with my daily cup of coffee and 40 oz. of plain distilled water.  I used to buy this tea in an 18-ct. box but the store that carried it wasn't ordering it consistently.  I'm so glad Amazon offers it in bulk. It comes out to be almost the same price as the 18-ct. box for $1.79.",positive
Love this stuff! I always have trouble falling asleep and this really helps me go to bed. It’s subtle but honestly makes you tired and you just effortlessly fall asleep. some other products don’t help me get a good nights sleep. I’ve tried a bunch. 👍🏼,positive
This is great seasoning for BBQing.,positive
Best fruitcake ever! Stays fresh when chilled- that is if it isn't gone in one day.  LOVE IT.....,positive
"I bought this coffee for my sister and because it tasted/smelled sooooo good, I kept it for myself and will get her somemore:)",positive
Use it for coffee. Just as good as any locally bought honey but a little cheaper,positive
"This is the best hot sauce I have found except for one thing.  There is sugar in it, and I have to be on a sugar free diet, so I use Cholula (especially Chili Garlic or Chili Lime) a lot more.Still this is the best.  If they came out with a sugar free version (Splenda?), I'd be all over it.",positive
this stuff is badass!,positive
It's everything you expect.,positive
I love sour sweets and bubble gum. This bubble gum is the best.,positive
"Trying to make efforts to decrease my sodium intake and this product looked like a good choice. I've never used salt substitutes before so felt overwhelmed with all the choices. I am happy with this product though.  It tastes good, and has no metallic after taste that I've read about with other substitutes. My order arrived quickly and intact. The price is higher than regular salt of course but it is a decent size bag and I will be using it sparingly. I would recommend this product.",positive
"How does Marie Callender's get away with selling this as chicken pot pie? All I could find was crust, a few peas and a microscopic orange thing that might or might not have been carrot. Such a ripoff. Just shameful.",negative
"I got this to use as a thickening agent but I rarely thicken things. More recently I've discovered it's usefulness in maintaining a nice consistency in my smoothies and other drinksI add a tiny bit and it seems to imulsify my smoothies, even better than lecithin. The coconut milk and nuts don't float on top like scum. It all stays mixed so nice, the small insoluble particles don't settle to the bottom.I just tried it in my keto coffee and it worked great in that as well. I only added a tiny pinch.It's been sitting on my shelf for awhile until I made an unusually stubborn smoothie that separated into layers. A little xanthan gum fixed it right up.I plan on getting another bag soonI store all of my powdered foods in lock-and-lock cannisters to keep from trying to reseal  them. Sometimes I keep the stuff in the bag, sometimes I just empty the bag in the container, it depends on how much I keep and how often I use it.",positive
"Good taste, wish it was a little cheaper, great for a low carb diet.",positive
Oh dear.  This stuff is much too delicious to last long at my house.  Prepare for addictive behavior once you taste this.  Hooked.,positive
"The Paraguay Passionfruit has a very nice, sweet and fruity taste. I have only tried the passionfruit and the peach teas but the passionfruit is my favorite, hands down! I don't mind the sweetener taste as I am used to having stevia with my hot brewed teas.",positive
The best tea ever very soothing,positive
I really do not like that my dried strawberries were more sugar than strawberries! My fault for not checking the “fine print”.,negative
Classic taste.  It will take you back to Costa Rica.,positive
"It is much less expensive to use this product rather than buying rice milk in the stores at over $2.00/carton - plus it tastes great.  The natural sugar content is very low, but it tastes sweet (sugar used is natural sugar.)  (I wish there were some way to make it zero sugar without artificial sweeteners, but it may not be possible.)  Overall, great tasting and a very good value.",positive
"tried others,this was the best",positive
"These are the most luxurious pears. They are sweet, juicy, and have a great texture. They are a little more expensive than the ones you buy at the market but these actually taste like a pear while the pears at the market have little to no flavor. Indulge yourself!",positive
These are so good. Just the right size.,positive
"Never had tea so fresh and with a great flavor.  The smell warms up the whole room, thank you! I WILL order more as needed, it's a must for my cup!",positive
This product has made a big difference in curry recipes and so many more. So nice to have a case in the pantry!,positive
"MOLD. Everywhere. Awful...how a picker at the warehouse did not see this is incredible and speaks to the expectations of Amazon in the Amazon DC’s (or the robots who cannot see mold).  Please fix this, it appears to be a problem.",negative
its really fresh it has reach taste i really recommend it,positive
"Big fan of Crystal Light sweet tea, couldn’t find at local grocery stores found on Amazon. Great value, great flavor.",positive
"What a horrible ""surprise!"" I was so looking forward to baking a chocolate raspberry tart with this extract.  I opened the bottle and added it to my recipe. Good thing I have a good sniffer, because I noticed an odd odor when pouring. I  grabbed a clean spoon and tasted the portion I had just poured. Much to my dismay, it tasted absolutely AWFUL. It smelled slightly of raspberry, but had a weird acrid, spicy, sour taste that smelled reminiscent of kerosene. This is not an exaggeration. Briefly, I wondered maybe I was in the beginning stages of COVID-19 and losing my sense of smell and taste.  I even had my husband and kids taste the extract to verify that I wasn't crazy. I thought maybe the bottle was expired. Nope, still a year and two months to go. Luckily I was able to salvage my tart by scooping out the yucky extract.  You'll be happy to know that Kahlua covered up the terrible flavor wonderfully. What an absolutely terrible product.  Sadly I wasted $9 because it is not returnable. If I were able to give 0 stars I would.",negative
Not soft.,negative
Part of what makes the perfect smoked baby backs.  Start with Sylvias rib rub n more and finish with Cowboy seasoning.,positive

My favorite with fish!,positive
I really liked how both candy bars were mixed into the package. There were equal pieces of Mounds and Almond Joy bars.,positive
"I love Hint water, specially Watermelon and Peach flavors.",positive
"This drink powder can be used just to add to water. I enjoy adding it to bolt 24 to get extra flavor and hydration. Also if you enjoy a more lemon (slightly sour) taste I add lemon juice,this helps me to not over drink caffeine. Have loved this company (true lemon) for years!",positive
I ordered these to decorate a fondant cake. The white pen that I needed wouldn't work at all,negative
"This tea makes the BEST cold brew iced tea I have ever had.  The mild, almost floral flavor comes out so well, with no bitterness at all. So good you wouldn't dare add milk or sugar!",positive
"These are great. Bright crisp flavor. Sometimes I really just want *something*, especially if i'm dieting doing hcg etc and of course I don't want to have sugar or terrible artificial sweeteners so this is the perfect answer.",positive
Fresh with lots and lots of initial flavor!!!Always have had fast shipping with purchasing from this seller.Would recommend :),positive
"This is my favorite for a tall and level sheet cake. I won't buy another brand. It is always perfect and so yummy!I don't like it for cupcakes, though. It seems that the batter fluffs out over the top of the cup instead of settling into the cup.",positive
Mailed out perfectly no damages. The product taste great.,positive
Very dark roast,negative
"Was nervous they would arrive melted but they were shipped with ice packs in an insulated bag. The chocolates are very good, but I do agree that they were not as puffy as the typical sponge candy. That said, they are delicious and kudos to the seller for making sure they arrived quickly and without issue.",positive
I use this instead of other rinse aids.  We have very hard water and no softener.  A generous dose of this in the dishwasher is an eco friendly and effective way to get dishes clean.,positive
"If you like balsamic vinegar, you'll love this glaze! We drizzle it on salad by itself or rigorously mixed with olive oil. The result is a dressing that doesn't flow through your salad but becomes a delicious part of it. Think of the other uses you have for balsamic vinegar where you want the intense flavor but not all the liquid.",positive
Great product. I love this cinnamon. Will definitely buy again.,positive
Bought this for my dad for Father's day and he loved it! One of his favorite kinds of coffee.,positive
"I truly believe that Gummi is the 5th food group and I typically order candy in 5 lb bags for myself and eat about 1lb a week.  I am a total candy junkie. Swedish Fish, German Raspberries, Fruit Slices, and the rest.  But these wine gums are the BOMB!  Seriously if you have never had them you just need to order some and experience the sublime taste and texture of these.  There are about 5 other brands of wine gums out there but these are the ones you are looking for.  Everyone I've introduced to these gems have had a similar reaction: ""What are these? They are amazing"".  But I have to caution you: they are very addicting.",positive
"This is the best premade brownie mix I’ve ever had. I’m an avid baker, and I’ve tried many mixes and recipes of my own, plus the other Ghirardelli brownie mixes. This one tops them all. Turns out perfect every time.",positive
"I make this several times a year for my family.  It’s a  complimentary addition to your morning breakfast.I make it in loaf pans, and refrigerate...(can be frozen up to one month).  I slice the loaf  about 1/2 inchs apart and fry in a skillet with a little bacon grease.  DELICIOUS!!!  Can be served with ketchup, maple syrup, or eat it plain.  Absolutely DELICIOUS!",positive
So excited to add these gems to my fitness routine! Thank you!,positive
"This edible luster dust is made in the USA. I've tried a few Bakerpan products and have liked them all so far. I got this luster dust in both the silver and the white and would have to say that if you're only using this on lighter colored products, you're probably not going to notice much of a difference. I suspect it'll be more apparent on darker backgrounds like dark chocolate. I used this to spruce up my light pink macaron shells using a brush. It went on with light strokes and gave it a beautiful shimmer with no apparent tint. Some of the shimmer also came off on my fingers so it can be a bit messy. I would definitely recommend if you're looking to add something to the appearance of your baked goods.",positive
"Delicate balance of flavour and scent, wonderful hot and unsweetened.  I had the 2022 version.",positive
"I have always loved these coffee nips!  It became hard to find them so I found them on Amazon.  Great when you want a coffee treat, have a nip!",positive
"I am trying to work more plant-based protein into my diet and decided to try this pea milk powder. I had never tried pea milk powder before ordering this, but I really like it. I've used it several times for baking in muffins and pancakes, as a topping for oatmeal, and I have used it in protein shakes. Like some other reviewers state, it doesn't taste amazing on its own, but if you add a bit of sweetener (I use stevia) or flavored syrup, it tastes quite good. I've found that it mixes best with a hand blender, although vigorous shaking works well too. The resulting pea milk is smooth and non-gritty.  I also appreciate that the only ingredient is peas--there are no other added ingredients! I'm very glad I decided to order this pea milk powder and look forward to trying it out in other recipes.",positive
A bit dry but tasted ok.  Not as good as I remember from being a kid,negative
"I really like the taste of these. There not really hot to me which is fine. The only problem was when they arrived my lid on top was split around the top. But they did not leak out. I kept my item, and they are just fine. I love the taste.",positive
Bought for stocking stuffer. The receiver loved it.,positive
"Was recommended by my brother to use this to get rid of the ants in the room. We’ve tried everything from bleach to vinegar but, dead ants keeps showing up by the window and on top of the heater. We put one package By the window and close the door and within 2 days we noticed there were only a few dead ants. We cleaned it and left it for another 2 days and when we went back to check, there were nomore dead ants in the room. This product works great. The only thing that’s not good is we shouldn’t be inhaling it so, we can’t leave it there while we stay in the same room.",positive
This pasta tastes as close to regular pasta as I can get.  I especially love the rigatonis!,positive
"I use this in many different ways.  It is great on a sandwich, great flavor in pasta, as salad dressing and much more.",positive
The price was 5 star for 4 bottles! Very similar to caramel.,positive
Great product very shinny chocolates and diferent sizes.,positive
"So good!!!! I made these for a bake sale.  I don't have kids, but the elementary school let me in.  Nothing weird about that, plus I got major brownie points for being eco friendly with my baking process.",positive
Taste & texture of home.,positive
"My childhood, revisited!",positive
"Nuts were fresh and delish. My new fav flavor. A little pricy, but worth it.",positive
I used it for my vegan shepherd’s pie with impossible beef and we never knew the difference.,positive
Delicious!  I have purchased other creamed honey in the past but this is the best.,positive
"This is a very potent garlic infused olive oil. It's very pricey for the amount (over $30 when I ordered it), but if you love the garlic flavor, you can't beat it. I've used it in a variety of ways (as a drizzle over bread and in dipping sauces, but also for cooking). One surprising use that worked out well was to cook my morning eggs in this. I usually found that if I used about a teaspoon of this oil and a teaspoon of avocado oil, it balanced out the amount of garlic flavor to be more manageable and also increased the smoke point to get my eggs crispy.",positive
Great for mid-afternoon snack or as a delicious nutty salad topper. I would total recommend as a staple in the cupboard,positive
"Love the crunch and taste, but a half-ounce for over $3 a bag is pretty steep.",positive
So cute!! Not flimsy at all! And so easy to put on the cupcakes.,positive
Taste very good..,positive
Please toast!,negative
I got the Christmas bag to put in everyone's stocking. The taste was awful. Was old' everything had to be thrown out. What a waste. Don't buy!,negative
Not sure how this product received so many 5 star reviews.  My experience was a little odd—the tea had a very strong bitter taste and didn’t have any of the typical jasmine flower scents I’m accustomed to.  Caffeine content was high and color was right.  Flavor profile was not acceptable.  ALSO: no return or exchange policy for this product!,negative
"Everyone seemed to love these and want more, you get a good amount and i have not been able to find any American candies that are similar to this one!!",positive
I absolutely love the taste and that it’s healthy all around! Maybe not for everyone but for me it’s perfect. A little pricey for popcorn but I guess considering everything it’s not too bad!,positive
Smells rancid when i just ooened it. Also looks old and not fresh whatsoever. Just go to Costco and buy it! DO NOT BUY PLEASE DONT WASTE UR MONEY! THERE'S NO RETURNS. Absolutely disgusting and stank up my house,negative
Just gross! Not sweet. Tasted like savory cornbread. Icing was gross. Don’t waste your time. Not worth the calories.,negative
Absolutely love it. use on ribs,positive
Love the cereal hate the high price.  I can get it a dollar cheaper when I go to town. But had Covid and was isolating from people.  So bought it here.,positive
Not the Spanish peanuts I was expecting they were more like redskin peanuts,negative
"Even if I did NOT have to eat gluten-free, I would love these bars, but they are scrupulously gluten-free, too, which adds the crowning touch for me.  Modest calories, high protein, low carbs and low glycemic index, and they taste great!  My husband even likes them :)  I've tried most of their flavors and have no complaints about any of them, but I like these for their subtle vanilla flavor.",positive
delicious and when refrigerated does NOT get rock hard so I've chosen to refrigerate it.,positive
"Mine came leaking and bottle was very warm to touch out of box . Wanted to try but disappointed when it came in that condition in a box with no cushion and I imagine heat , being tossed around in box contributed to leaking bottle . Did not try as not sure if leaking was prior to shipping issue or a shipping issue that caused it . Bottle itself was very sturdy heavy glass with Goonsquad boys on the label lid was plastic without a safety seal under cap only outer shrink plastic . Smelled good just didn’t want to risk it with open leaking bottle to try .",negative
"Would give zero stars if i could.  of all things to be delayed and late, on top of that it is laying around in a truck in the houston heat.  good job everyone.",negative
"It really is a simple as adding water, mixing, and putting it in the microwave for 30 seconds. Which is awesome!It puffs up into a muffin shape in no time at all (and then kind of deflates a little as you bring it out of the microwave). I was expecting a soft or mushy center - but it had the same consistency throughout. It's a little more ""sponge-y"" than a normal muffin, if you use the amount of water in the instructions. If you use a little more, I've found it's more moist and more like the texture of an actual muffin.I had the blueberry flavor. It's not like having real blueberries - it doesn't have the juicy center of a real blueberry - BUT it does have a REAL blueberry flavor (or at least pretty darn close).I also had the Lemon Poppy Seed flavor - delicious!(Side note: My friend mixes the powder with water and eats the ""batter"" raw. I've never tried that, but he says it's good too).",positive
My family says these are really yummy - they were gone te day they arrived.,positive
Great tasting bread toasted with butter or with a little peanut butter.  Yum!!!  ...and it has a long self life!,positive

Tasted good while drinking but has a weird after taste that doesn't go away for a while (for me),negative
"We always drink this every morning. Today I opened a new box of the French roast. Horrible bitter taste, and exp date was just a couple of month away. Makes me furious to have this happen.",negative

"I was hesitant to try lactation teas but I needed something to boost my supply.  I like Munchkin's lactation cookies so I gave these teas a try.  I am happy with my purchase of the lemon flavor.  It is easy to drink.  I'm purchasing again and this time I'm going to buy the berry too.Daughter self-weaned so I decreased my pumping sessions.  I went from having 32+oz/day to about 20oz a day.  Then it started to drop even more.  I was concerned and stressed because all of the sudden, my daughter wanted lots of breastmilk again.  I dropped down to 15oz/day and after drinking at least 1 teabag a day and hydrating throughout the day, I'm back up to about 25-27oz a day. It works for me.",positive

"I hate leaving bad reviews so I’m going to start with a positive.  You get a lot of tea for the money.It doesn’t taste good.  I get nauseous a lot and peppermint tea really helps me.  The flavor of this does not settle my stomach at all.  There is a small hint of peppermint, but for the most part it’s drab.  Doesn’t have that refreshing peppermint kick like the tea I’m used to.  Bummer because there’s A LOT of it.",negative

One of the snacks for my customers,positive
"No, these are not real sweet ""Candy Bars"". They are not meant to be. They are fiber bars and that means they fill you up, (and move things along faster in your gut.) Hungry between meals? Eat one of these with a hot beverage (speeds up getting the food into your system), and you will be full and satisfied. Real good at cutting ones appetite a half hour before meals too! With only 150 calories they are not a diet breaker, rather they stop you from eating something that would be. Its not fat or carbs that matter so much as total calories for the day. Eat it very slowly with your hot tea or coffee, and you may be full with only a half a bar!",positive
Liked everything about this product. Will continue to buy.,positive
So delicious and a great option for my child with multiple allergies.,positive
taste and smell is great... I lov this black tea,positive

"i had previously ordered a couple of jars of Felix lingonberry jam.  it was tasty, but a tad on the too sweet side for me.  if you want a great jam, order that.  if you are looking for a lingonberry sauce, you've found it here...  has some sweetness to it, but mostly just wonderfully tangy lingonberries.  fabulous in crepes.  perfect complement to chicken.",positive
"Substitute real Juice of a Blood Orange, instead of water called for on box. Loved this cake, very moist and tasty with a cup of coffee.",positive
"The taste is OK, I’ve had much better. But the pieces of jerky are so hard I can’t eat them.",negative
Perfect just like in the small bags from the store but much more economical for us who eats a bag a day! Bagged by the “candy company” that sells bulk candy but has official Haribo inside!,positive

"[[VIDEOID:fab02b12b049410999015010c565fabf]] Candy size misleading for $17.00 I expected regular size hard candy with an old fashioned fruity taste. WRONG, tiny pieces and a weird muted taste possibly because of the crushed candy dust. Yuck I’m going to try to return them.",negative

"Love the taste..better iin soup n salad...nice change of pace..did not like the larger pieces, so a few hits in the processor..PERFECT.",positive
My son really loved these.,positive
They do taste good though Zesty Ranch doesn’t taste like most ranch flavored things. There is a very satisfying crunch and I would definitely not miss chips with these available. I did not try the spicy because I don’t like spicy. Family member tried them and liked them,positive
I brew 20 oz per k-cup and it still has a nice Medium roast taste.Not bitter or too much acid.Economical $0.42 cents a pod.I recommend this brand.,positive
Not what we were expecting and we did not enjoy them at all.,negative
"I buy this all the time! My whole family enjoys it, including a 4&5 year old. We melt cheese on ours wile cooking and we can't get enough.! Yes it's a tad expensive but I live in the ""sticks"" a lot of people tell me and I can't get it around here. The flavor is on point every time!",positive

"I ordered the Bloody Mary flavor. They didn’t seem very fresh, kinda dried up, and the flavor should have been called Bland Mary. They were a little salty but my husband and I couldn’t really detect other flavors. We expected a bold taste given the name, but they were really disappointing. I ended up giving them to a neighbor who is less of a “foodie” than I am.",negative
Calorie count too low,positive
I have used this brand of Orange Flower Water for 20 years and favor it over all other brands. I use it mostly in Italian desserts which come out with a marvelous taste and nice fragrance.  Suddenly 3 years ago I was unable to locate Monteux brand and tried other brands that turned out to be a disappointment since not being the same high quality. I am pleased to find it available again.,positive
Easy to cook.  Can be used with many other food products,positive

The most tastiest mayo ever. And very cool container.,positive
"I bought this color because in the pictures it’s a light tan color. When I first opened it, it got on my finger and turned nail pink so I decided to test it on a small portion of icing. It turned blood red like the picture I attached. It was not even close to what I needed or what is advertised!! Then I couldn’t get the lid to properly seal so it started leaking out of the side and I ended up just throwing it away. I’ll never buy this kids again!",negative
I can’t return them so I had to throw them away. I bought them for a party.  I was going to display them.  cracked and broken macarons was not the look I was going for.Waste of a lot of money,negative
"Love this dressing, it’s not like a sweet 1000 island, it’s has a lot more dill and I love it!!",positive
"Umm, these will now be a staple/recurring order in this house. So delicious and fresh. It is also a great value for these Chia Seeds. Highly recommend!",positive
These taste just like the chicken you get when you order Sweat&Sour chicken from the local Chinese place. They take on whatever flavor you add very nicely.,positive
"I love this tea.I love that it's organic. I love that it tastes good (as long as you monitor it and take the tea bag out before the tea is ""stewed,"" (as the British would say). I also dislike the price in my local Whole Foods Store. They want $4.99 for 16 tea bags. Even though they're organic, that's ridiculous. Yes, it goes on sale occasionally, but not often enough.Fresh and Easy Organic Green Tea with Lemon Grass costs $2.99 for a box of 20 tea bags. It's good, and I use it often, but I just prefer the taste of the Choice Organic Premium Japanese Green Tea.BTW, the Choice Organic Regular Green Tea is not exceptional. You're better advised to buy something else organic and cheaper than that.I hope and pray that no one discovers that this product is not organic after all! I guess we have to trust. How would the average consumer know?",positive

Splenda minis are great. They fit in my purse nicely. Often restaurants don't have Splenda packets available and Equal gives me headaches so these solved my problem.,positive
The perfect dark and creamy chocolate. Very satisfying.,positive
"Now, I'm a bit of a Peppermint tea snob / expert as I've been drinking it for decades - I'm from Germany, and it's a lot more popular (and cheaper!!) over there than it is here. I'm still amazed after having lived here for over two years at the very limited choice in grocery stores and how overly expensive it is! Anyhow, I recently bought these, not expecting very much at all because I always thought this kind of herbal tea really needs to steep for quite a while to get all the essential oils out (when I use tea bags, I usually just leave them in the mug), so I was afraid with the way the Keurig works - pressing the hot water through the pod within seconds - there wouldn't be much flavour. How wrong I was! This tea has an awesome minty flavour, even at the medium sized cup setting I chose! I highly highly recommend and will certainly get this again - also can't believe this great price on Amazon!!",positive
This product is no longer in stores and very expensive,positive
I’ve been using this product for months. It provides the most consistent flavor when using it to make cold brew. The larger size of this coffee is perfect for the batch brewer.,positive

"Having heard about this brand of coconut water on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast I was excited to try my first can. Tasting a new brand of coconut water can be intimidating because you never know what you will get. Will it taste sweet, salty, or just perfect? With C2O I was pleased to have tasted the finest coconut water to come out of a can.I have been drinking coconut water for years from various brands with mixed results. Most coconut water sold in stores is packed with enough sugar and additives that the seemingly harmless drink your purchased is no healthier than a soda. C2O is sourced from young Thai coconuts with no added sugar. What you taste is what you get, and what you get is delicious as hell. It's the closest you can get to a fresh coconut without having to go outside.My doctor has been getting on my case the past year about my low potassium levels and has recommended I eat more bananas. I hate bananas! One can of C2O contains the amount of potassium found in two whole bananas. Goodbye cramps.It's delicious, refreshing, packed with potassium, and offered at a good price through Amazon. The only downside is having to wait for my weekly case to arrive.",positive
Very tasty. Great over casseroles,positive
First purchased this from a big box store in the smaller pouch but they rarely keep it in stock. This has lots of good stuff in it and it tastes great. I use it with Almond Coconut milk and raw spinach to make a smoothie.,positive
This is definitely 100% cacoa,positive
Love it! Great tea lovely smell wonderful skin toner.,positive
Great coffee.  Very full bodied.  My favorite!,positive
"This is probably the most authentic tasting no dye thai tea and I've had my fair share of them. This is how I've been making them for the best flavor:Pour Over Method:Place 2 tbls spoons of tea per 8 oz. Into filterPour over a little hot water to dampen tea, then wait a few minutes before pouring the rest of your water.Add 1oz-2oz (Taste and add more or less) of Vanilla Coffee CreamerAdd 1 tbl spoon of sugar (optional if you want it sweeter)Cold Brew (My personal Favorite)Add approximately 2 1/2 tbl spoon of tea per 8oz cold water into a Jar or container.Add Cold Water and Stir Just a littleLet Mixture sit for at least 12 hrs or 24 hours (Best and most Flavor)Add 1oz-2oz Vanilla Coffee creamerAdd 1tbl spoon sugar (if you do this make sure to add the sugat first and stir until dissolved.This stuff is delicious!",positive

This double fermented Kikkoman soy is the bomb! The taste is absolutely fantastic and wakes up your taste buds. I’m hard pressed to use any other soy now.My only wish is that it came in a much bigger container. The small bottle doesn’t last long with me.Been a loyal Kikkoman Soy user since growing up in HI.,positive
Delicious!!!!!! My only complaint about this product is the difficulty getting all of it out of the jar!!!  I was afraid the taste wouldn't stand up to my daughter's picky taste after having the popular name brand. I was so excited to find an all organic version and too top it off my daughter LOVES it!!!! Well worth it!,positive
We have been a fan of this product for over 10 years!  Its quality is consistent and it is easy to make.  Everyone we serve it to raves about how wonderful it is.,positive
"no glutenThis is excellent! I am so glad to find it here at amazon. The local Whole Foods stopped carrying it, and my bread is not as good as before. I make bread in a machine. Sometimes I mix the flours myself and other times I use Paula's. Mixing my own g-f flour returns good results, but it is very time-consuming. Paula's mix is convenient, but the texture with Bob's Red Mill is so much better. It is never spongy! My whole family loves this bread and they are not even G-F! I am, and I love this.",positive
Mixed with white masarepa  meal to make Columbian style Arepas. Taste was very good.,positive
"Cento Crushed Tomatoes give you what you should expect, quality and quantity. I used the tomatoes as a pasta sauce and was so impressed with how the thickness of the juice increased in the cooking. My sauce stuck to my pasta! I didn't add any seasoning to the sauce, only the meat. Try it with ground turkey seasoned with garlic, it's heavenly.",positive

Pure triple filtered carbonated water, sugar, citric acid, natural flavors with extracts of Florida oranges and Ecuadorian mangos.",negative
"I got these for me and my husband as we are  working from home . I thought these would be great for  sitting and working for long duration of time  , easy to replenish energy. Unfortunately  we did not like it. In fact my husband hated it so much that  he told me  he will cancel my amazon account. I bought these after seeing all those reviews but I guess it depends on personal preference.",negative
"Favorite K-cup flavor. Tastes fresh, not crazy strong, and, best of all, works with the keurig 2.0 without any hacks or anything!",positive
"Use this on veggies, makes them taste richer, buttery, without the calories",positive
I love it but don't tell anyone.  I don't want them to run out.,positive
We tried spelt pasta after we discovered wheat allergies in our family and the allergist said spelt might not cause the same issues.  We've tried the shells and elbows.  We prefer the elbows as a pasta dish as the shells are very small.  But the taste is equally good and we've had no trouble switching from the white or wheat flour variety pastas.,positive

"I had run out of the oregano I brought back from Greece and was worried about the quality of products I’d order on line.  This did not disappoint.

"So, I bought this bread after reading positive reviews. I really only wanted to scratch a French toast itch after a few months of keto. I figured after cooking in butter and drowning in monk fruit syrup it couldn’t possibly be that bad. I. Was. Wrong. It has a taste/texture combination of corrugated cardboard and a stale sink sponge. I tried to let it sit for a little but that just made it chewier. I also tried a piece of regular toast with butter. I could not finish it. Although the sponge aspect was absent, it was replaced by a tree bark essence. I’ll try anything 3 times. If anything miraculously changes on my third try I will update this review. If you are doing keto, just stick with the  foods you already know.",negative

Would like a refund item to expensive,negative
Tea is a great value for the price and the assortment is nice.,positive
I liked the smooth and soothing flavor. I drink as mid morning beverage or just a little cup in evening. My daughter gave it two thumbs up.,positive
This product has always been a staple in our New England traditional Saturday night baked beans dinner. I knew it would cost more as the company that produced it closed. At over $11.00 per can on Amazon for something that was around $2.00 I ordered only six cans and it will be used only on a special occasion. They should be ashamed to gouge people so!,positive
Taste great like all Caffe D'Vita products.,positive
I have to say my interest was peaked when I saw these and they did not disappoint. This is the one flavor they should sell in the big plastic box and they unfortunately don’t. Try them! So delicious.,positive

"I bought these for my boyfriend, who does a lot of work outdoors and at his job. I worry about him getting dehydrated, but he really enjoys these as a snack when he gets home. He’s a picky eater, so I know these are  good when he comments on how great they are.",positive
"I purchased this from the seller Cambie Distribution, this is my third or fourth bag of this type of cocoa powder, and I’m very disappointed in the quality from this seller. It normally has a robust chocolate aroma you can almost smell through the bag, and certainly once it’s opened, but this bag has little to no aroma, in fact smells stale. The color is similar to other bags I’ve bought, but it seems this one was either stored poorly prior to my purchase, or might not even be a legitimate bag of the Cacao Barry brand. I will definitely buy the cocoa again, but for sure not with this seller... buyer beware!",negative
"Excellent quality, delicious taste, pure sesame milk with no additives.  Please bring this back!",positive
"So I thought these things were candy that LOOKS like other foodSo far, we have tried the cheeseburger set.It was so much fun.I bought 2 cases to give away for giftsThe meatSmellsLike beef bullionThe French fries were actually potato-likeIf you cannot read Japanese, there are many videos on YouTube to demonstrate how to prepare these.  Super fun and interesting.",positive
"These very tart flavorful hard candies are delicious.  I first purchased a bag in the local Home Goods Store...they only had one bag in stock.  I searched for them on Amazon and I was so happy to find them there.  The flavor is great. They are extremely tart, but are so good, if you're looking for that feature.  They are a little pricey for the number of candies, but I would buy them again.  The ones I bought are the lemon flavor, but I'd also like to  try the orange.",positive
Really love this coffee and the price was unbeatable.,positive

This was a good deal ; to buy a carton of them.,positive
Got these to make extract with and it has turned out super great!,positive
"The taste is amazing. I bought 3 bags and will definitely buy more. Since this is freeze dried this is a great snack to keep in your car, or have in case of emergencies since it lasts for a long time without going bad. This particular brand has fruits as well (which I have not tried yet because I prefer the taste of veggies and savory snacks but I will look to purchasing in the future.)Although this is a bit pricey it's a great alternative to snacking on fatty foods or potato chips and a little goes a long way. I usually am satisfied with a small bowl of these but if you want to polish off an entire bag you can be confident you're just eating a ton of veggies and nothing more.",positive
"Quick delivery,  packaged well- great variety of snacks. I'm supposed to keep our office stocked with a variation of snacks,  and this box was perfect!",positive
"Weak flavor, water and guar gum added as fillers.  They are too cheap to create a real coconut milk product.BPA lining in can is especially bad since fat is particularly good at absorbing it.We are giving up on canned coconut milk since the sellers are not able to provide a decent product.  Luckily making it from scratch is very easy.",negative
"Very high quality, as one would expect with Dole. These have a lovely flavor and the light syrup is ideal. And from Amazon, the 6-pack is also very reasonably priced.",positive

Taste very nutty! but is great for diabetes and will buy again,positive
The product must have gotten very hot at some point. All flavors were spoiled and tasted terrible. Had to throw it all away.,negative
"Got addicted to the MEATLOAF [Smeatloaf Double Beatloaf]. They are designed to be quick preparation, but I do prefer to kinda chop it up a bit with the fork/spoon before nuking for more even heating. Quite flavorful and a single inexpensive tray does the trick when I'm in a hurry or just plain lazy.  I love that they are shelf storable for a year or so.I'm not typically a prepackaged meal type so I can't say too much about the other varieties although I have tried the Turkey before which was pretty good.  Recycle that (rinsed) tray and cardboard.",positive
"I was very excited to try this based on a lot of the reviews i've read online. People were like ""OMG! How did they do this? How did they get it to taste exactly like the original?"".....nope.This drink sucks.

"Finley ground, smooth and light/medium roast flavor.I enjoy coffee and the only downside is that if I have that one extra cup it makes me jittery and I do not like that feeling.This coffee allowed me to enjoy one more cup without that feeling of the jitters.I like the mild flavor.The ingredients are a plus for me, Lion's Mane is great for supporting cognitive health, Ashwagandha is helpful fir support with stress and restful sleep.Yes I would definitely  order this coffee again.",positive

What you expect from Samoas GSC.,positive
"We drink this coffee everyday in the morning, and it feels like we are in Italy . It taste very good.

These are great. The coconut chips are the best. Apple is 2nd and banana 3rd. Will be buying again. Great alternative to chips.,positive
Good product. Fresh and decent price.,positive
Expensive and not refundable. Half my packets were mushy and looked moldy. Waste of money.,negative
Recieved two of these as 'give aways' from a health store. I ate one and my wife ate one both at seperate times and both thought the taste was so bad we actually didnt finish the bite we'd taken. They tasted almost sour.,negative

I bought my bucket of whey powder packets over a year ago and as I write this review I am drinking delicious whey powdered milk mixed with purified water from my Berkey. As far as I am concerned this powder exceeds that taste and creamy texture of whole milk. I figure in 2036 if I am still on this earth, I am more than likely going to be sipping delicious dairy beverage  at 2016 dollars.",positive
I was a gift for a friend that loves this tea,positive
Great product! It is real buttermilk that is powdered. Works perfectly in all my cooking. It lasts a long time and stays fresh. If I can use a full quart or half gallon of buttermilk I will buy it fresh. Otherwise I waste most of it since most recipes do not use much.,positive
"So delicious! I'm very health conscious and these are my go to, favorite chips!",positive
"It’s kind of big! A little hard to store in my spice cupboard, but it’s a fabulous spice and adds spunk to any dish.",positive
"Great taste and flavor, great price and fast delivery. I absolutely love coffee and chocolate, and these two put together is ingenious. The fact that it’s dark and milk chocolate is a bonus.",positive
Great amount for the money,positive
This is my favorite coffee ever!  And I'm a Starbucks fan!,positive
I enjoy this drink whenever I feel a bit tense.  Seems to help in smoothing things out.  And I enjoy the flavor very much.,positive

"I'm obviously a minority reviewer here but my whole family agreed that this was the least favorite of the extracts we've tried. The McCormick's is the better of the mainstream extracts, Rainbow is also much better than this. Between Rainbow and McCormick I'd say McCormick was our family's preference but some of the more obscure were even better. I wish Hires still had their original. My grandparent's generation loved that stuff. I'm too young to know about that.I like Wintergreen/Minty fresh crispness in Root Beer but it's got to taste somewhat real (even though most is art flavor for Wintergreen) and it can't be overboard since it's a strong flavor and easy to overpower with. McCormick has a little less than they could have in that dept maybe but it's a good and somewhat natural tasting extract. This Zatarain's is much too strong in the Mint/Wintergreen flavor and it's not a real tasting wintergreen it tastes like Bengay back cream artificial tasting. Whatever they used for that ""Minty"" flavor may make a good scent for a product but not a good flavor in my opinion.Not a fan of the Zatarain's RB extract.Also if you're shooting for an off the shelf taste as a starting point, I haven't had a root beer that tastes much like this. McCormick's is pretty generic tasting but good. You could probably get to an A&W flavor using McCormicks if you tried.Tried it with a variety of sweeteners (Honey, HFCS, Sugar, etc).",negative
I purchased these as a replacement for pineapple mango because my husband couldn’t find the pineapple mango I’d been used to at the grocery store. I like the pineapple orange banana much better. Too bad the grocery store is not my go to anymore. :) ;),positive

Not worth the $$.  Arrived in smashed up box and with butterfat milksolids whiting out the chocolates.  A few had melted into each other and tasted dusty.  NOT the same quality as when purchasing direct or in Europe.  Won't be buying again.  Amazon customer service in the Philippines didn't seem to care to fix the situation so just gave up.,negative
"I was really struggling with dry skin for a while.  I tried this and it cleared up in under a week.  I don't use this daily anymore (opting instead for a moisturizing face wash), but it definitely got the job done and is still my go to.",positive

Need to be ashamed of themselves. Nothing like in the pic. And boxes are small.,negative
I’ve never had any juice that’s tasted as good this cider and I don’t think I ever will.,positive
"Bitter taste, flavorless grape cent, and there's no way to return. Good job, Amazon.",negative
Tasty and I'll be eating them instead of potato chips. Some complained of packaging and smashed chips. They fixed that problem as mine arrived in a tough cardboard box with zero damage.,positive
This is a great alternative to unhealthy chips!  Very satisfying!,positive
My girls eat a lot of popcorn. This is a great deal for a delicious popcorn! Not a lot of left over unpopped kernels either.,positive
"And it really does, too.  One of the original Crystal Light flavors was Lemon Lime, with the same very pale green color when mixed.  I drank it pretty much every day, and was sad when they discontinued it, as I've never found anything quite like it - until now.  This Sunkist Lemon Lime flavor tastes EXACTLY like the original Lemon Lime Crystal Light - I love it!",positive
I've enjoyed these mints for years but they're not easy to find! I was very happy to treat myself and a few lucky friends for Christmas. Fresh and delicious bas ever!,positive
"Delicious hot sauce and wow does it pack some kick. As someone who tries to push the limits of my own tolerance, this is a tough sauce for daily use. Dont get me wrong I LOVE THIS PRODUCT but be careful especially because this bottle doesnt have a “no spill” top. You can easily turn a delicious meal into an epic battle lol. 5 stars",positive
"rich chocolate taste, excellent product",positive
"This is my new addiction. Once this is available for subscription, I will unquestionably be signing up.You can't beat the price on these and they give a great little kick of energy. It isn't like a Venom or Red Bull kick. It's more like a coffee kick and is great for people who aren't crazy about the taste of coffee or don't feel like a hot beverage. It's also much easier on my stomach than cola, which is what I drank previously and it has less calories.This is of course available in a bunch of flavors. This one is the best. It's like a fizzy fruit punch that puts me in mind of the kind of punch they used to make at parties when you were a kid. Fruit Punch+ Sprite or Vernors. Just fizzier.Warning: You're probably going to crave it once you start drinking it.",positive
"Amazing! I recommend using this company. The picture I ordered was exactly how it came in the mail. It was flawless! They were quick to respond to my messages, and I received the product a week early! :-)",positive
It’s ok but dislike the package. Way too hard to open and will not stay airtight. Why the gigantic footprint when we have transfer product anyway? Why not package in a more simple container? Will not buy it again just because of the container. Product seems average compared to other latte mixes one-the-market. The best begins with a G...sorry people.,negative
"Very happy with this product. Great aroma, excellent taste and does not give you the jitters.",positive

awesome and fast shipping!!,positive
Brings back memories. I know a lot of vets hate them but I love them! Thank you!,positive
"It was very tasty, almost like what I ate at Hot n Juicy. I only used a spoon of powder so I think I can use this package for a year, if I make shrimp boils every month. For your reference, this is what I did.1. thaw frozen shrimps in a bowl of cold water(jumbo, 20-30), steamed 2 corns&6 small red potatoes.2. melt one and a half stick of butter and put 2 Tb minced garlic. Be careful not to burn garlic.3. add a table spoon of this spice + lemon zest from a jumbo lemon, white and black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika powder(the amount depends on you)4. Put defrosted shrimp into butter with spice, mix gently.5. Add all other ingredients(corns, potatoes, sausages), mix gently. (I added more paprika and cayenne pepper here for the color)6. Transfer all things to a plate. Serve with wedged lemons and parsley leaves.",positive
"I love these noodles. They are much tastier than Cup O Noodles or Maruchan instant. My husband, who is a huge fan of hot chilis and peppers, likes how spicy these are. I usually use only about 75% of the soup base, to cut down on how salty and spicy I make my noodles. An advantage over cups of instant noodles - we get to use less of the flavoring if we want, since the soup base comes in its own packet.I also like the bowl these come in. Another pro over instant noodles in a cup is that there is room in these bowls to spare. That means I can add green onions, kimchi, crab meat, an egg, or anything else I want in my soup on top of the noodles.I buy these online because they are a better deal than getting the single noodle bowls at my local grocery store. They do carry this 12-pack at the Asian market in the city, but prices are not marked and shopping there is always more of an adventure than something I do regularly. It's easier just to order this on Amazon and have it delivered rather than make the hour-long drive myself.",positive
"Upside, they are amazing! Chocolaty and delicious.  Downside, you can only buy them by the box.",positive
Awesome flavor closest to fresh brewed!,positive
Good To The Last Drop.  No more Folgers for me.,positive
These did not taste very good.  In fact I threw them away.,negative
Fresh!!!!🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Delicious 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Value for $ 🌟🌟🌟🌟It's not that expensive if you use it over 7 days! Less than a $ a day! Worth the $ ❤,positive

Purchased these for my nephew’s marvel themed 4th birthday party. The little ones were ecstatic when they found these in their goodie bags.,positive
Got this for my dad for Christmas and he absolutely loves it.,positive
Going from simple syrup to Whiskey Pig maple syrup is an absolute game changer for the perfect Old Fashion.  Full of flavor but not disgustingly sweet like standard syrup.Worth every penny.,positive
"I tried a pack randomly today at Starbucks.  I wanted something different from the banana bread or chocolate-covered graham crackers that I would otherwise buy.  This is some solid trail mix.  I highly recommend.  As a matter of fact, I am on amazon now to buy more of it so I can let friends try.",positive
GreT variety of morrocan seasonings! Nice addition and different addition to the spice pantry-make a great gift for any chef.,positive
Think the headline says everything necessary.,positive
"My husband hates cheese, and even though I felt this tasted borderline cheesy since it is mixed with cream he loves it and I do too! What a miracle. It is really good with the mushrooms and the shallots, but we actually use boneless chicken instead of pork. I can't thank you enough for selling this in bulk, because I originally found it from a small bodega on clearance.",positive
This is good honey. It has a good strong flavor. I am not one who likes a mild honey and I always prefer a raw & unfiltered honey. This is delicious and I will buy again.,positive

"Bought this originally at a local deli here in Salt Lake as an impulse buy (there are several flavors).  Love the flavor of the Habanero sauce, and it has some kick to it.  I add it to sauces and store-bought salsa to add some kick, but a lot of the time eat it as is on chips.  I bought it again on Amazon out of convenience, but will admit that it was cheaper at my local store, so will be going back to them next time to help keep the little guys in business.",positive

These are great meal replacements. My mom really likes them. She’s always running errands so these are her quick meals. She says they taste good. I get her vanilla.,positive
"Reasonably effective horror/science-fiction a la ""Alien"" is fairly well done given its limited ambitions. Some nice special effects and well paced action sequences adequately patch the cracks in the rather tiresome dialogue. When a space craft crash lands on a remote planet the survivors soon become aware that a hideous terror awaits them in the dark of the upcoming total eclipse.",positive
This was perfect tastes just like I remember the salted Pretzels from the mall,positive
"This is amazing! they’re fresh, they came fast, and they taste good! genuinely surprised",positive
Coconut flavor is nice. Hazelnut and chocolate just shines through. High quality with freshness.,positive

"When I read the description is stated - SHAKE SHAKE 15 (Disposable Bottles). I understood this to mean I was receiving 15 individual bottles of the Orange Pineapple Shake. When the order arrived there were only 6 bottles.  I've ordered this same item from a local Doctor as well as an internet supplier, I know how much this item should cost, even with seller mark up I've never paid more than $2.00 per bottle. There is no way I would pay $3.50+ for this product- when I know I can beat the price. $15.00 at the price this seller was charging is in the ballpark of what I'm used to paying.  Imagine my surprise when I only see 6 bottles. Returning this for a refund and going back to the retailers and providers I'm used to.",negative
Great design. Very comfortable,positive
Good all around assortment for Halloween,positive
"I have no idea what is in these things, but I love them. They're supposedly healthy, but they taste like a heart attack. Worth it, either way.",positive
"I like the taste. It is a nice snack between meals, and a great source of fiber.",positive
I like the flavor here. I bet it comes in those nice little packs boxes. And they were delivered really quickly. The only thing I don’t like is expensive they are. But what is it right now? Everything is expensive. I’d buy more if I could afford it. I’m gonna fix income so it’s hard but I love them and recommend them anytime.,positive
"Great product,and great price! I will order again soon!",positive
"Yuck, extremely dry. Nothing special about this product at all.",negative
"This is my favorite of the Frontier soups. This soup is delicious hot or cold. In fact, I plan to make it this hot July week and eat it as vichyssoise. Hint: use the ""Steamables"" brand 1.5 lbs red potato microwaveable bag for the potatoes. They work great, and are super easy!",positive
Delicious coffee! I am not a coffee expert but it seems like an excellent roast. The beans have a nice shine to them. I will buy more and more now that I am addicted.,positive
"This is a gift for a friend who loves Cadbury…so I have not opened it. I was, however, surprised and impressed at how fast I received it and at how big it is!  The large tub of chocolates will make a most impressive gift. I’m sure my friend will love it!",positive
Love it!Great for soups and cooking in general!,positive
"I've been eating Kraft's caramels since I was a kid. these were a BIG disappointment. they've replaced the artifical butter with PALM OIL...caramels are not supposed to taste like coconut, they're supposed to be buttery. I can tell the difference and Kraft's Caramels are now off of my list. it's a sorry sorry thing after all of these years.",negative
"If you are into seriously burn-your-butt-hole style hotsauce, get this. It is an instant and extremely intense front mouth heat. The big issue here is that there is absolutely no indication to the brand's heat on the label, therefore  it sits unassumingly on the shelf like any other typical hotsauce. While it is labeled as habanero, there are several flavorful habanero sauces on the market that are balanced, not too spicy, and delicious. Don't let the mango fool you, it is pretty radical for anyone to assume/claim they can taste anything but burning tongue flesh. I tasted one tiny drop and consequentially spent the next 15 minutes trying every capsaicin deactivating trick in the book, to no avail. My mouth burned uncomfortably for about 20 minutes  My girlfriend has been writhing in pain all morning.",negative
"No packaging issues or weird smells/taste.  I am enjoying these drops - they are super sweet, so a little bit goes a long way. Not as bitter as stevia in my opinion.",positive
What a rip off should not be allowed to sell on Amazon,negative
There are other cashew butters better than this.,negative
Expensive but very good. Meant to challenge traditional sodas like Coke and Pepsi. I think it tastes much better and it’s not loaded with sodium. The downside is the cost.,positive
"When I was first introduced to this soup, I realized that it would fit into all the recipes that called for ""cream of""  soup.  It really has a nice flavor and I have used it almost exclusively for several years.  Now suddenly it is not in my Walmart store, or any of the Kroger stores in my area.  I am very disappointed in not being able to find it.  Thus I had to order a case.",positive
We love this fennel pollen--we use it in a pasta recipe. It smells wonderful.,positive

So good in rice and cold water for flavor.,positive
"These roses arrived very quickly. They were gorgeous! They came in a box with the stems wrapped in a wet paper towel type of material. The vase was included and plant food to extend the life of the flowers. They came with care instructions. I trimmed them to better fit the vase and to a height I preferred. They stayed very vibrant and gave me days of pleasure. They were nice, full sized, beautiful blooms that opened gradually as the days went past. I highly recommend these roses and the company I purchased them from. Very reasonably priced too.",positive
"I have tried a lot of canned tomatoes for the production of pizza sauce. Lots of DOP San Marzano products that cost a lot more. Amazingly, these tomatoes have come up on top for me on flavor.",positive
i had to buy a box of these because everyone keeps swiping them out of my bag at work. they are not easy to come by at the stores around me.,positive

Bought these for my brother -in-law for his birthday.  I snuck a few just to test the flavor.  They were delicious.  Will purchase next year for him for his birthday,positive
Picked up a couple Pomegranate bottles at my local Asian mart. Pleasantly surprised to taste fruit vinegars instead of the typical offensive kombucha salad dressing flavor. Give this a try.,positive
"I lost count of how many jars of the Airborne Manuka Wildflower Honey we've bought after the count got beyond 100. Manuka can be so strong that it just tastes ugly, but this version tastes great and still has the great health benefits of the Manuka. Also, not that this affects the taste or 'food' quality, but the packaging is so darned attractive, right down to the squarish jar...although I DO wish the jar was glass since I've kind of gone off plastic. Overall, though, it's just great. Only from New Zealand! Love that country!!",positive
Love that I could but these in bulk! My kiddos love it just as I did as a kid. We’re going to use for party birthday bags.,positive
"If You know Matcha, then you will  recognize the quality of the tea...  It is probably the best one I've tried so far. I think there was another one I liked but this one just blends really well, and  it's a very dark green color which shows it's at authenticity. ..., and yes it's straight up Matcha!...it's not Starbucks girls and boys... This type of tea should not come sweetened,  that's why iit isn't , yet still holds a lovely flavor.... I make my own "" Green fraps"" at home and they turn out great with added sweet cream....  Delicious !",positive
Gorgeous lime green,positive
Really embarrassing to have a client not know whom this basked was from when they received it. I won't ever use this company again!,negative
Simple ingredients make this jerky amazing!,positive
I tried the Uncle Jerry’s extra dark and these. Imo these win hands down. The reason? They have more of a deep almost charred taste. I want my extra dark pretzels extra dark. The Jerry’s were not nearly as dark in appearance as well as taste. The Jerry’s were very crispy and very salty. Which I love. But I love an almost charred taste even more. The splits in the Uniques really brought out the deep roasted flavor. They are truly addicting,positive
Excellent quality fruit. Very fresh and very reasonable price. Would highly recommend.,positive
"Nuts are old and taste weird , it seems like i paid for peanuts not for other nuts as quantity of peanuts are more. never buy pantry from amazon",negative
These are addictive! They taste great but only for a few minutes. They like most gums lose flavor quickly.,positive

"Want a simple-to make and economical meal? Then you should try this. If you aren't familiar with it, it is a basically a ready-made roux with curry spices already added. Added to meat and veggies as the last step in the simple preparation process it flavors and thickens into a sauce. The instructions call out a meat, chicken or pork or whatever as well as onion, potato and carrot. They are rather specific about quantities but in reality a pound of protein and a small potato or two, a couple of carrots, and a medium-sized onion work and you can always add perhaps 1/4c of extra water to stretch it out. Oh, they call it medium-hot but in reality it is not at all hot and it won't offend the tongues of the timid. I used to buy this all the time but after I moved to a new state I found that the local grocery stores didn't carry it but now I'm able to keep a couple of packages in the pantry for when a hearty but simple meal is needed in a hurry.",positive
I got this for my husband for his birthday.  This is very high quality coffee with chicory.  The decaf version is not usually found in local stores so I am grateful that you have it available online and at a reasonable cost!,positive

Olive oil has become GOLD at the supermarket. You have to sell your first child in order to buy it 😂. This is fairly priced and taste good for the amount you receive. 👍,positive
"Delicious! Interestingly, there were only 3 ingredients and all easy to pronounce because they were plain food items. These are made in Spain. It makes me wonder why here in the US we need so many chemicals in our food for a worse tasting product. These are delicious!",positive
"Great value for organic oil. I prefer this tub in solid state, we use it for all kinds of things- I originally ordered it to use as a lubricant on my breast pump, later found out its good for baby acne, cradle cap, and pretty much any skin issue in babies and adults. We will always carry this now. If using for cooking you can let the tub be in a warm spot and it will become liquid. Tom keep it solid (has consistency of something like vegetable shortening or Vaseline) just keep it in a place that's under 77 degrees. We keep it 76 in our house so it'd just fine at room temp. It can also be refridgerated.All in all a great value at this price. Cocout oil at the grocery costs twice this and is not organic",positive
"I bought these at Peets near me, thinking it would contain real Peets Forte, or Major Dickenson. This coffee is NOT any of Peets existing blends. Its produced in Europe, priced and tastes about the same as Nespresso. Why bother ? (not sure where all the stars are coming from...)If you want real Peets blends, I suggest the capsulin-in fillable nespresso pods, use Forte, Major  D, or whatever you want. Much better at a fraction of the price !",negative

"or if you're trying to get your family to eat brown rice, but they don't like it, then this is the rice for you. It has way more flavor, fiber and nutrients than white rice, but you wouldn't notice that it wasn't white unless you compared them side-by-side. It has a nutty flavor and a great aroma while cooking. There is just no reason to buy white rice if you have this hard-to-find product. But be forewarned...if you like real brown rice, you WILL be disappointed. Personally, my family and I LOVE it, and have it at least three times a week.",positive
I liked this. And was very happy with the price.,positive
"These are delicious!  To me, the chocolate coating is buttery and the biscuits have the perfect crunch.",positive
"The water tastes like tap water, and I had a stomachache right after finishing the can. Also the can (notoriously) looks like beer and I’m tired of stares so I just don’t drink it at work or outside in a park. So I’m drinking each can in my car, torturing myself to finish all the cans because I paid 14 for 12 of them. Too expensive for a water that tastes no different than tap water. I’ll stick to Ozarka for the best water.",negative
It works for me.,positive

My local store stopped selling this so I've had to buy this large box on Amazon. As of the date of this review, this item is out of stock on Amazon. I'm hoping they get in soon because I'm down to only a few packages left.It's flavoring is rich, has small pieces of dried red and green pepper and jalapenos (but not enough that kids would notice), mixes into the meat smoothly and has the right amount of spice meaning it's a true medium flavor.",positive

Delicious!! The peanut butter one is amazing!!! Excellent product and even a thumbs up from my 10 year old daughter!,positive
The flavors are very good and hit the spot for sweets.,positive
"The product picture shows 2 containers. The description says '2 decadent flavors"". When you order, they don't ask which flavor you'd prefer.Reading the specs after receiving just one flavor, I realized that item quantity is 1 and weight is 8oz so I guess technically they're not lying when they ship you one 8oz container but it's a pretty scuzzy way to do business.Tastes pretty good though.",negative
"Just received the shipment of Supremo Italian Cannoli Shells.  The box was clearly marked, ""Fragile - This Side Up"" in 5"" black letters.  Typical of FedEx, the box was left at the bench at the front door with ""This Side Up"" vertical to the ground instead of on top.  An initial, quick inspection of the inner box of cannoli shells revealed that the top layer of shells are unbroken.  The box contains plastic trays with slots large enough to hold one shell, similar to plastic trays used to hold cookies sold by Keebler, etc.  Will not know if there is any damage until the entire contents of 48 are removed, which will not be for a week or so.  I will post an update on the freshness and taste when the shells are filled and eaten.Last Christmas we made our own mini cannoli shells.  They came out great but took extensive time and labor.  Four of us took a different step in the process: rolling the dough, cutting the circles, wrapping the circles around the stainless steel tubes and then frying them. Believe me when I say buying them pre-made is worth the cost.",positive
Berry Burst was the favorite cereal of half of our family!  I wish Cheerios would stop making new flavors and stick with those we loved.  The fruit was delicious and plumped right up.  A whole breakfast in one bowl.  Bring back this cereal!!,positive
"I don't drink coffee, but I understand why people do...this is my coffee, but in a quick shot.  I've probably ordered this 20 times..can't get over what a bargain it is over 5-hour energy-type shots and how much better it works!",positive
lollipops thrown in some plastic bag not an original tootsie roll bag.  That does not speak highly of product safety.,negative
great flavor and price since no need fir refrigeration keep several in my locker at work and in a small half pint container in my pack will purchase again,positive
"I read the reviews and knew this wouldn't be sweet, but I thought it would at least taste good. ICK. It's gross! I've used a little and a lot, and do not get anything close to a caramel flavor. It tastes like FEET! I wish I could send this back. Plus, the pods are very tiny. Not worth the money.",negative
The peanuts are TOO SALTED. I hope the producer could use FAR LESS SALT.,negative
When I couldn't afford the Beef flavor the Soy Sauce did the trick for me. 👍🏾,positive
They have changed the flavor,negative
Good to the  last drop.,positive
"Bought this when my usual Just Egg was out- never again. This tastes horrendous, texture is completely off putting, and it smells questionable at best. Next time my usual vegan egg replacer (seriously Just Egg great) I’ll just go without.",negative
"I am always a little skeptical when I see a company trying to copy Nutella but was willing to give this a try because well lets face it Peanut Butter & Co. has done some awesome things to peanut butter!! Upon opening the jar I could smell the hazelnuts, and stirred my jar to blend it. This spread is a just a little thinner than Nutella but taste SO MUCH BETTER!! The hazelnuts shine through the chocolate, and it is not so sweet either. I'm a convert! The fact that this has more protein and less sugar makes it a healthier choice also,I love the taste of this, so cannot wait to try the dark chocolate one!",positive
I drank one bottle and had extreme stomach pain. I didn't know for sure if it was the water or not so in a couple of days I drank another and even worse pain to where I almost went to the hospital. Beware,negative
Received fresh...,positive
"All of them were yellow, rotten & disgusting!  Very disappointed & will never order again! Big waist of money!!",negative
All four jars were leaking.  They went straight into the trash.  What a waste!,negative
We grew up on Bonomo Turkish Taffy.  THIS IS NOT that product. The candy was very stale and lacked any flavor.  We couldn’t even get the paper off.  To charge $29 and not offer a refund is outrageous.,negative
"We like Orbit Gum.  I like this assortment because it includes various sizes, including packaging that fits right in your cupholder.  The Spearmint is good, it's what I ordinarily would be.  Honestly, it's hard to find anything negative about gum.  It's nice to have it on hand.  We are going on a plane trip soon and I already grabbed 2 packs to stick in my purse.",positive
Sooooo delicious! I also put some nuggets into my Trader Joe’s unsweetened insta t oatmeal with a few banana slices and voilà a super special snack or meal! So good!,positive
They came sticky and melted I can’t even eat them,negative
This is a delicious product. I am glad I found it. It makes the BEST roast beef sandwich!,positive
"I just brought out my nespresso machine again, and I'm not disappointed with these pods. Love the variety. Will buy again",positive
See earlier review.  Awesome product!,positive
"The meat quality is actually good, but whoever slices it is too lazy to cut reasonably thin slices. I'm not looking for slabs of lunch meat.",negative
"We like coffee somewhat strong ant thought this would be good. Not bold at all, very weak if you make more than a 6 oz cup.  I use 2 pods to make 12 oz. Earlier I purchased the Amazon Brand - 100 Ct. Solimo Dark Roast Coffee Pods, Compatible with 2.0 K-Cup Brewers way too weak also, gave that away. I like the Maud’s Gourmet Coffee Pods – Tall dark and Handsome, 100-Count Single Serve Coffee Pods, very strong and bold but last time my wife said it was a little bitter. I will probably reorder the Mauds.",negative
"These were delivered faster than what I thought. They are so delicious! They are soft and great flavors! I love Lemon flavor and powdered donuts, so I couldn’t be wait to try these! Tasty Kake products are very good and don't disappoint! I wished they sold these products locally on the West Coast!",positive
Like and used for my daily martini,positive

Very large bag.,positive
Heavy Syrup is the best..,positive
Just a perfect deal for an Italian coffee,positive
This low carb granola is absolutely delicious!  It’s part of my regular amazon haul and it pairs perfectly with flax or almond milk when you are looking to get more protein in your diet!!,positive
We keep these in our pantry for those times when we are at a loss for what to eat.  Can dress it up or eat it straight with the provided sauce.,positive
"This is by far the best cinnamon sticks I’ve ever bought. I’ve added to coffee, tea, and alcohol mixed drinks. It hit your taste buds at just the right moment to make you say hmmm, is that cinnamon? Love it!",positive
"First time using harissa, in a ratatouille learned from Jamie Oliver.  We’ll keep a jar handy from now on.  Good stuff.",positive
This is by far the tastiest tuna I've ever had.  I buy it often through Amazon Prime and make sure we always have some on hand.,positive
I'm not sure what type of red red you guys are using with those raving reviews but this tastes awful! I've bought a set of colors from chefmaster before and they were wonderful  taste-less so I was hyped and bought a huge bottle of red....now I want nothing to do with it.,negative
"Great! Just add a small squirt to a 16 or 20 ounce bottle of water, for a nice flavor with about zero calories....",positive
"I volunteer for a not-for-profit organizaton that provides scene support to our county fire departments.  We set up a comfort station whenever there is a fire or other disaster for the first responders.  We provide water, powerade beverages, coffee, hot chocolate, snacks, heating or cooling depending on the weather, even dry socks!  We have been looking and looking for bags of mini pretzels, a favorite of the fire fighters because of the salt.  Thank you Amazon for helping us help the first responders in our county!",positive
This is hands down the best tasting plant based protein :),positive
"I grew up eating dried mangoes that we bought in Chinatown, and I guess I learned my lesson about uh... what kind of manufacturer to trust, when it comes to making an edible product. I get the whole... healthy food thing. This snack is tough, lacking flavour, and the pieces look like scrap ends. I understand wanting something without excess additives, but nobody needs to be this afraid of taste.",negative
Gift for college student.,positive
Best tea. My grocery store no longer carries it. Happy to have found it here.,positive
The limes I received were exceptional!,positive
Melted together.,negative
"I used on my Reuben,  and tried it for my shrimp Louie salad, amazing on both. I love Kens",positive

Glad to have this old favorite back,positive
GREAT TUNA -,positive
"These were awful, not crunchy like cereal marshmallows.  They were chewy.  Would not buy these again",negative
"I tried the coconut and almond versions and the almond was only slightly better, but still horrible. I thought toasting it would help but it didn't. Don't waste your money!",negative
"Black Tea flavored, very tasty.",positive
"This Chocolate Chunk Mini Cookies is very delicious! Even these cookies have chocolate chips, it’s not very sweet, which is good for those that are diabetic, and it’s made with almond flour, this is the snack that you should go for! Definitely recommend 100%!",positive
"good price, keep it up amazon, thank you",positive
"Great item, will order from again",positive
"I can't describe this, I haven't done any heavy drugs in my life but this is literally liquid cocaine. The first day I had a cup I got out of my house without a door and I live on the 2nd floor - I just koolaidemanned through the wall. I went to work finished all my work for the year - this was in January and then came home and rebuild the wall I broke through earlier, devoured my girlfriend to near death - she was still having orgasms a week later, developed a new software program, wrote a screenplay(and sold it) increased my bench one rep max to 450lbs. With all that done in one day the next day I retired to a mansion in Turks and Caicos and built a safe/underground shrine for the remainder of the bag of this elixir of productivity. Now if I want a kick for a good day I just sniff a whiff of the scent and get through a whole day as if I snorted red bulls, but I won't drink another cup unless there is a hurricane I have to withstand cause I am genuinely afraid I would become obsessed with power and take over the world, and I just don't want that kind of responsibility.",positive
Some of these off brand pods just don't produce quality coffee in the Nespresso brand machines.  This one does. Great price and surprisingly nice espresso too!,positive
"Bought this 5 lb bag for personal consumption. Since most local markets charge 4 to 5 dollars for a 6oz package, this reduces the cost of one of my favorite snacks (and regular recipe ingredient) to a fraction or what I usually pay.",positive
I’ve used many kinds and these have the lowest ash I’ve found and the most efficient per pound. ONE THING I RECOMMEND is to store them in a cool dry place and don’t move them around a lot. By default there is not a lot of wood dust but if you move them around a lot it will obviously cause dust (this happens with other brand pellets too).,positive
"I got some at a store and thought they were great.  Then I ordered them from Amazon and realized they are MADE IN CHINA!  I won't feed my dog anything from China, much less my family!  I threw them in the trash.",negative
I was hesitant to buy this after all the negative reviews but I took the plunge and so glad I did! They are yummy and have the perfect chewy consistency. I will say they are very spicy! I love ginger but these definitely have a kick.,positive
Love the flavor.  Sugar free and decaffeinated is my preference.,positive
One Tiny bag showed up. Total over priced.No way to return. They show it as three bags and you get one TINY BAG!,negative
"I’ve tried ruby red grapefruit, ginger ale, and blood orange. Out of those flavors I really like the blood orange even though the others are good flavors.This really helps when I’m studying and gives me the energy to continue.",positive
"Best jelly I've ever had! Fresh berries, nuts and so delicious!",positive
"Yet another short cut product from krusteazIt's certainly not producing a waffle with as much flavor as those I make from scratch but some days I just don't have time to prep that AND cook the waffles.The taste, without add ins, is vaguely reminiscent of eggo waffles ;) I agree with previous reviewer about adding in a bit of vanilla or other extract but they're fine without it.",positive
"This seasoning mix really is all-purpose. I have been adding it into just about everything I’ve cooked, with great success. It adds such an appetizing flavor to my food.I highly recommend giving it a try!",positive
"These roasted pecans are so good, very flavorful and have a light, crisp crunch.  I eat them right out of the can, but also really like to put them on salads and often slice them up to put in chicken salad.  Mmm!",positive
I think they could really stand to be bigger bags then they are as the bags are really tiny esp some flavors more then others!,positive
"Mild flavor, I can use the whole packet, unlike other brands that I have tried that I have to use have half because they are too strong.",positive
"Horrible pre-packaging not done with common sense, chocolate was MELTED,was not chilled or protected from HEAT, shipped in a Amazon envelope, the chocolate package  was Flimsy so it got damaged easily from heat I mean come in. Doesn’t even look like it was in any cool environment on the way here. I’ve ordered  plenty foods needing being chilled, never like this can’t even enjoy it",negative
Do not buy.  Arrived late and this is what they looked like not even 12 hours after arriving.  Don't waste the money.  I asked for return/refund,negative
Neutral tasting coconut oil. Not a bad price either. Perfect for vegan butter,positive
the best sugar free gum on the market.  love this stuff,positive

Really good green tea on the go I like the way it's packed in right amount the Right mix tear it pour it go,positive
Smoothest pb ever.  Our family favorite!,positive
These tastes great and were a good price. Texture and time wise they seem to need to cook a little longer than red or green lentils to get soft.,positive
These are awesome. We have only tired the jalapeño one but it was great! Good flavor and a small amount of hotness. What you would expect for a jalapeño pepper. I feel like what I paid for these is perfect and you totally get your money's worth. My 8 year old wanted them because of a challenge he saw on YouTube. He is going to try the ghost pepper and habanero with his grandpa.,positive
Very pleased with coffee.  Can't get it in the stores.,positive
Taste like sugar great for my blood sugar,positive
"Good product, good price for this quantity.",positive
I’m disappointed in how small it is,negative
Yuck! I could not get past the taste. I gave the whole box away!,negative
Make this at a higher pressure than normal and you will be in heaven. My ONLY complaint is the 5lb bag didn't come with a deathwish sticker.,positive
Liked that it was all milk chocolate.,positive
"Stay away from this.  It was dry, dry dry!!!!!!!!  The topping was minimal at best.",negative
They were not black as pictured at least half were broke and they seemed old very dissatisfied and beware you cannot return,negative
I think this tastes more creamy than whole milk. Reminds me of milk straight from the farm. I like it more than non fat varieties. Milk is expensive where I live and this costs about the same. Nice to have a back up supply.,positive
"Watched a TV show People’s Republic of Fermentation part 3. Was about exactly this bean paste. I’m always  curios to try new things. I didn’t regret it. The flavor is dramatic. I put just a little bit in my food ( baby steps, my family is not as Adventurous as I am ).  Everybody notice the difference and tried  to find out what ingredient did I use .",positive
I have ordered this several times now and am completely satisfied with this product. Why is the Nativas brand more than twice as much? Oh well - I'll just keep on buying the Healthworks one!,positive
I don't get why vegans try to emulate foods that are off limits for them... This is a complete joke... Seed oil is toxic for any human to consume... Then the fact that they charge way more for this than normal cheese... It just shows you how idiotic the whole vegan industry is.,negative
"Absolutely not the same as Senseo vanilla pods I've purchased in the past. I thought it was just different packaging, but it's a completely different product. I taste no vanilla flavor at all. Complete waste of money",negative
"Says it's imported from Australia, but it was imported from the UK. Different product.",negative
Nice size and cool box,positive
Arrived fast and is exactly what i needed,positive
Bought for the drink of the month I made for the bar I work at. Tasted great in the drink,positive

Very good for High bleed pressure,positive
I usually buy Hickory Farms' summer sausage. This was just as good. Will keep this brand in mind for the future.,positive
It is so tasty and I like it on eggs and even on ice cream. Yum! If you like spicy food you should like this.,positive
Don't buy. Half came unseld,negative
Arrived quickly.  Well packaged.  Fresh and delicious!,positive
Huge bag!Great buy for your money.Haven’t used as a tea but I have soaked my feet and in the process of making some oils great for those uses. Will always but from this brand! Flowers look fresh and smell even better!,positive
"Big label on the box reads “artificial flavors”. The label is not shown on the item description, and it provides a warning to the consumer that some of the ingredients are not healthy. Such a warning is not provided in the item description.",negative
"I love fresh juice, and I love green mixes. However this one in particular tasted so bad, I couldn’t figure out or pinpoint exactly what it was but I had to toss it.",negative

I was skeptical of dill pickle pork rinds... oh man am I glad I tried them!,positive

"Bragg Nutritional Yeast....Non-GMO, Gluten free, Vegan, loaded with vitamin B, need I say more? Oh yes I can, it tastes so good. Crumble up some tofu add some onion and garlic seasoning. Then add a good amount of nutritional Yeast. Mix well and cook it in a iron skillet with some Braggs Olive Oil, YUM tofu scramble. You can also sprinkle the yeast on popcorn and spray on some Bragg Liquid Aminos.",positive
I always order my K-cups through Amazon love the price and quick prompt delivery right to my door. When ordering online the item is just about the half the price you would pay at any store.,positive
"I have been using these for a while now.  They have remained very fragrant and fresh.  There are so many, if they started becoming less powerful, I would just add a few more to my dishes.",positive
"The package that was sent to me had different ingredients.The image of the ingredients says:“Blend of black teas, natural and artificial vanilla, fruit and citrus flavors.The package I received says:“ Black tea, vanilla flavor, black currant flavor, natural bergamot oil, caramel flavor. “Plus, the color of the tin is not white like my original (which I purchased at the store) , it is cream colored.",negative

Love traveling with this. I can’t tell difference between this and fresh.,positive
"I do agree with everything Calamine has said! And I don't always agree with people, but what Calamine has said is very true, it is time for the girls to move on to better roles. I would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and I would like to see them grow as people, actresses and in their career as well as their personal life. So producers, please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the tangent a bit, move them into a new direction that recognises them individually and their talents in many facets. This movie that is being commented is not too bad, but as I have seen further on in their movies, their movies stay the same of typical plot and typography. When In Rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so hence I think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds, maybe some that are like the sixth sense, the hour, chocolat, that sort of movie - not saying to have just serious movies for them, humour ones too yes, but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and New York Minute. (Note: I am from Australia so excuse my weird spelling like reognise with the s instead of z)",negative
We haven't been able to find these spice drops around town for years. My father-in-law used to make a Christmas treat every year using these drops mixed with salted peanuts. We were so excited that we could finally make this treat again after not being able to for so many years. These drops are so fresh and worked beautifully with the salted peanuts mixed in and of course they were so good on their own as well.,positive
"I picked this up because I was looking for soda-flavored gum beyond Hubba Bubba Dr Pepper and Extra Dessert Delights Root Beer Float.The five flavors are billed as ""orange soda,"" ""cherry cola,"" ""grape soda,"" ""lemon-lime soda,"" and ""root beer."" This is wishful thinking. The four fruit flavors are nearly indiscernible from any orange, cherry, grape, and lime-flavored gumball you'd get out of a gumball machine in the mall; soda has little if anything to do with it (although you might get a hint of cola from the cherry ones if you think about it really hard).It took me the longest time to figure out what, if anything, the tan speckled ones taste like (the gum has a strong but generic candy coating taste). They remind me a little bit of gummy cola candy; I don't get root beer from it at all (compare and contrast to Extra's delicious Root Beer Float).The gum itself isn't very good. It sticks to teeth, it loses its flavor extremely quickly, and it's hard and rubbery.I wasn't impressed at all with this gum, and I definitely wouldn't buy it again. It works out to about 14 cents per piece at the time of this writing; you get what you pay for.",negative
It's sugar. It's sweet. It's organic :),positive
Chicken fried rice baby!,positive
I was looking for a healthier alternative to the syrup usually use for Italian soda and found this. I didn’t think it would work in cold beverages but I gave it a try and it does. It works marvelously and tastes great. It tastes a lot more like dates than the usual but that makes it more interesting.,positive
Love these bars and you can’t beat the price. Love that it comes in a variety pack.,positive
I'll never make my own royal icing again.  This product is jet black and dries perfect.,positive
"It is one of the best gummy bears I've had, 12 different flavors, sooo soft and the bag was full,I and my kids love them.",positive
"Item was not spoiled due to the poor packaging. Lid was dented, allowing contents to be spread about the inside of the box. Taste is flavorful but not exceptional. Much more runny than expected. I'll eat it but will not purchase again.",negative

I've ordered this dark assortment on multiple occasions without issue however tonight I received the coffee that I ordered just to find out that one of the 4 coffee's that I ordered is the wrong one.

"Once we figured out the oil to popcorn ratio that worked for us, this has been great.  We bought powdered flavors which work great to change it up even more.  A little difficult to clean. Would be easier if the top flap came off of the burner, but we make it work with a scrub brush.  It is a big family hit! We also bought big reusable traditional red and white popcorn tubs.",positive
Bought these for my mom for Mother’s Day and she loved them! She would only share one with me. The rest were paws off!,positive
"surprisingly good, love it on popcorn",positive
I love coffee and I love this teecchino delicious alternative!!!,positive

"This was a delightful surprise with the brisket being tender, moist, juicy, just the right amount of smoke flavor. Hosted a party highlighted the brisket everybody was full with a smile on their face. Had enough to share for take home and took some over to my elderly Neighbors. Have a second brisket in my next Amazon order. It comes in two packs and it's wonderful to have one in the freezer, defrost quickly for unexpected guest.Want to add I have ordered again the brisket is absolutely delicious it's a party favorite, I believe I always will keep brisket in the freezer. This company offers quick-service wonderful Packaging and absolutely delicious brisket.WELL, place my third order for brisket . It's very simple to prepare, if you've read my review, I've said it all, try it you will not be disappointed..******More brisket has been ordered, and I thought I'd enclosed the way we enjoy to eat it here in Oregon, at least at my house. Warm brisket in a little beef broth mixed with barbecue sauce heat for about 20 minutes on 200-250.....I like to use the sweet Hawaiian buns toast them just a bit, pull  out the brisket, you can open the rolls and dip them in the sauce or the juice that the brisket has heated up in and pile on the brisket, you're going to have to roll your sleeves up  while devouring these brisket sliders ... juice will run down your fingers as you laugh with glee, lick your fingers and stick another briskets slider in your mouth.... this is some of the best brisket I have ever had, I will continue to order. Also you can open a can of baked beans spicing up with a little bit of pancake syrup grain mustard and cut up pieces of brisket.... you will be a hero for sure.",positive

"Will order again. Great company.Some benefits of cocoa nibs:To get these benefits, the cacao needs to be pure. One of the purest forms is in the beans themselves because they have the least processing, and includes cacao nibs. Cacao nibs are cacao beans that have been roasted, separated from their husks and broken into smaller pieces. Their health benefits include:1. Maintain Muscle and Nerve FunctionCacao beans are one of the best magnesium-rich foods around. Magnesium is a mineral needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in our bodies, and cacao nibs contain 272 milligrams per 100 grams.Magnesium is key to muscle and nerve function, keeping the heart rhythm steady. Thanks to its high magnesium content, along with the effects of epicatechin, cacao improves muscle structure and enhances nerve function. (3, 4)2. Help You Lose Weight and Keep You RegularYes, you can lose weight when eating cacao! Now, it’s critical that you keep this in check, as cacao is high in fat and calories, but if you eat pure cacao or cacao nibs, you can get lots of fiber, which makes you feel fuller.Don’t confuse this with chocolate bars found at the grocery because you don’t get any dietary fiber when you eat a chocolate bar, but one ounce of cacao nibs has nine grams! That makes cacao nibs ultimate high-fiber foods.In addition, the fiber found in cacao may help keep your bowel movements regular. In a clinical study, subjects were given cocoa powder supplemented with high-fiber cocoa bran twice daily for two four-week periods, separated by a three-week period in which cocoa was not consumed. The frequency of bowel movements increased and feelings of constipation decreased during the periods when cocoa powder was consumed. (5) The raw cacao in these supplements was behind the constipation relief.3. Prevent AnemiaIron is necessary for red blood cell production so as an iron-rich food, cacao can help fight anemic symptoms. You can get 6 percent of your recommended daily iron intake per ounce from raw cacao nibs.Iron deficiency has side effects like fatigue and malaise. Thankfully, iron is abundant in cacao! To better ensure proper absorption, pair it with a good vitamin C source like a piece of fruit. (6)4. Reduce Risk of Coronary Disease and StrokeAntioxidants from chocolate are probably the most common source of benefits that we know. Cacao beans, especially when eaten raw, are some of the most rich high-antioxidant foods around thanks to the phytonutrients available in cacao nibs, helping absorb the free radicals that cause damage in the body.A study published in Contemporary Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine reported that epidemiological data shows that regular dietary intake of plant-derived foods and beverages reduces the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. In addition, the study demonstrated the beneficial effects of cacao on blood pressure, insulin resistance, and vascular and platelet function. (7)5. Treat DiarrheaCocoa beans have historically been used as a treatment for diarrhea due to the polyphenols contained in cacao, which inhibit certain intestinal secretions. In a study conducted at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the dose-dependent effects of flavonoid compounds present in cacao, or molecularly closely related compounds, were tested, resulting in the possible prevention of the buildup of fluid in the small intestine that’s associated with diarrhea. (8, 9)6. Enhance MoodNeurotransmitters are the little messengers in our brains that tell our bodies how to behave, ultimately affecting our mood. Cacao and cacao nibs have this amazing ability to act on those neurotransmitters.Chocolate in the form of cacao stimulates the brain to release particular neurotransmitters, like euphoria, that can trigger emotions. There are two chemicals that cacao produces in our bodies when consumed. One is phenylethylamine (PEA) a chemical that our bodies make naturally. We produce PEA, an adrenal-related chemical, when we’re excited, which is what causes the pulse to quicken, providing us with more focus and awareness. (10, 11)The other is anandamide, which is a lipid found in cacao known as the “the bliss molecule.” It has obtained this name due to its natural molecular shape, which represents that of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

"I bought the Annies Homegrown Microwaveable Mac-n-cheese.  Actually my wife bought it because it is so-called ""healthy"".  It was hands down the worst macncheese I have ever tasted, and after trying it, I would be loathe to try any more Annies products.  It had a nasty plastic-like aftertaste, I had to rinse my mouth out.I am throwing away the remaining 4 packets because I would not feed the crap to my cat!  This is a definite DON'T BUY IT!",negative

"I’ve been a satisfied user of the Salted Caramel sugar-free syrup for a few years.I thought I’d sample a different flavor of their many offerings.  Unfortunately I did not enjoy this at all as it has a strong, unpleasant artificial aftertaste.I’ll stick with the salted caramel",negative
"Both jars made it intact to my overseas location in Germany. The color was lighter than I expected but it tastes so good, I'll eat it out of the jar!  I pair it with a Pecan flavored almond butter on zero carb bread for an almond butter, jelly sandwich.....or on toast in the morning.  Will definitely buy again.",positive
"My moms favorite apples are Arkansas Black. Unfortunately, few orchards in NC actually carry them and there seems to be a short window when they’re actually available. Kauffman Orchards shipped a huge box of beautiful, unblemished Arkansas Black apples to us. They’re packed so that even if they’re dropped a time or two during transit, it won’t damage the apples. I’m so thankful for their service and will definitely be buying from them again!!",positive

I simply can't believe that it is only 5 calories because it tastes so good.  I'm on weight watchers, so I'm ""counting"" everything that goes down the hatch, and this is the best mid morning and/or mid afternoon snack.

"So disappointed that the Oreo box and contents were damaged. The shipping box was in good condition so I bet it was damaged prior to shipping. My son and I were really looking forward to building this house. We usually build traditional gingerbread houses on Xmas eve and thought this would be a fun/exciting and welcomed change. But alas, now I have to waste time on Xmas eve either baking or buying a gingerbread house kit.... it’s not important to me tbh, but my son was really hounding me about this Oreo house only to not be able to build it.

Oh one plus it is known for burning fat.",positive
My son is absolutely in love with these things! When you order these you get a huge box like how the super markets get them! There's 7 in each box. I usually order two units considering my son goes to my friends home to be watched for the day and she requires just snacks. It's convient with just handing her a box of these delicious snacks!,positive

These go for 2 for $4.00 at a carry out and are excellent. I mix into an ice cold glass of sweet tea all day long and it taste fantastic.Doing this I can stretch a can out an entire day and maintain energy.Has very little sugar at all but a big kick of caffein which I certainly need.The only Monster plus tea mix that is better was the Rojo tea but they all are good. Loaded with vitamins as well.,positive
"If you are a coffee Connoisseur, then you should be drinking Lion 100% Kona.  My wife is from O'ahu, and if anyone asked her what the best Hawaiian coffee company is, she would not have to even think-LION KONA.It has a flavor like no other coffee on the planet.  Bold, but not bitter.  It has a mellow after-taste, and a hint of sweetness.

"So good!!! I have to be honest, I’ve developed a tiny “dependency” on Yerba Mate tea this past couple months. So I’ve been trying just about every different brand I see. I recently ordered Teakoe’s Yerb Peg Leg. Wow!!! It’s delicious!! I love drinking Yerba Mate because of the energy boost from the caffeine, but also it just really makes me more focused, I can think more clearly, and it just seems to make my day a whole lot brighter. Teakoe’s did not disappoint in the slightest!! I will be ordering another case as soon as I finish this review, in fact.

Love the heartiness in oatmeal and cereals. Tasty!,positive

The package designer for this product should be fired. The project inside is still the same but it's almost impossible to use effectively the way the double pouch is constructed.

"I love this coffee and have introduced many of my friends to it. It's mild, smooth, and aromatic. I'm not a fan of strong coffee and this is not heavy or bitter.

"On of the best substitutes for sugar I've encountered. Only be careful if you use it for baking, as it will not 'dissolve' as sugar, but seem crunchy. But to put on pancakes and oatmeal, or add to youghurt if you're craving the sweets without the calories, it's superb. It's supposed to be more natural than other sweeeterns and does not have the bad rep of aspartame.",positive
"I was SO looking forward to getting and using this seasoning. Received it today...the shaker top is broken and the freshness seal wide open. I would still use it if just the top was broken, but I don't trust the safeness of food products that are unsealed.

"I prefer to order pre colored fondant for dark colors. I usually use renshaw but they wouldn't ship in time. I'm not a beginner and I know very well how to work with fondant. This had the worst alligator skin out of any fondant I have ever tried. It was cracking as I was rolling it out. I had to take it off of my cake, mix in some white renshaw and add more black coloring and finally got it to some-what work. I will definitely never buy it again. The only plus I can say about it is it doesn't taste too bad for a heavily colored fondant but not worth it for how terrible it is to work with. Now I have a huge tub left that I will only use for details on little figures.",negative
"outstanding product and price. most local stores want me to buy only about one-fourth the size of this product but for the same price. here. i received about 4x's the amount for the same price!Makes all your baked goods super fluffy and creamy and rich, especially white cake.I use this in place of regular milk.",positive

This is the best gum ever! It’s a very healthy type of gum compared to Extra which has artificial flavors and not so healthy pesticides.,positive
"The product is Jehovah's gift, and I am so glad I did not find the problem with customers who reported finding mice dropping and bird feathers.  Emotionally, that is devastating, but logically, it must be understood that the temperatures at which the tea has to boil will in all probability kill any bacteria or germs.  I bought a small stainless steel teapot, with a built in lift out strainer,  from Amazon and am so glad I did because I can leave left over tea in the pot and place it in the frig to keep it from bacteria developing or spoilage overnight.  It might have been hard to find space with a regular sized tea pot.  The strainer inside also keeps anything undesirable from entering the liquid poured by spout.",positive

"I bought a small packet of this at a local pharmacy to try it.  I LOVE the strawberry banana flavor.  I was so excited to see that it contains probiotics, and plant based proteins, monk fruit extract as sweetener... all excellent choices. Most protein powders (that I have experienced) do not contain all of these good for you ingredients and I end up buying several different products to get these beneficial ingredients. Thank you OWYN.  and I am super excited I can buy the Strawberry Banana in a big container.  :)",positive
"Ever wondered what you might feed your cats in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic future? Mushy, grayish-brown bits of something that couldn't resemble tuna any less, suspended in an oily liquid with a vaguely umami, vaguely spoiled tang. I tried to drown it in salad dressing and every bit of seasoning I could find in the break room at work, but I managed only to make it palatable enough that I could keep it down. Absolutely revolting.",negative

"As someone who enjoys eating fish and sardines, I was very disappointed in these sardines.  I have tried most brands of sardines and eat about 5-6 cans of sardines a week.  These sardines were extremely salty and the fish had a slightly off taste to them.  The sardines were almost as salty as anchovies.  I looked at the sodium content and noticed that it was same as some other tins of sardines that I had on the shelf but for some reason these were much more saltier than the other cans.I tried two tins thinking that it could have been a tin of sardines that were over salted.  The can was also difficult to open but I've noticed this problem with other sardines from Portugal.  A difficult can does not bother me as long as the sardines are worth the effort to get the can open.I had read a review online about these sardines and wanted to try them.  I usually do not write reviews but wanted to warn others.  I would suggest buying one can and trying it before buying anymore.One of my favorite sardines for the price is the Matiz Gallego Sardines in Olive Oil [...]  The Matiz sardines are nice and plump and have an excellent flavor with great texture.  The quality to price is excellent for these sardines.Da Morgada sardines are my favorite as this current time, but Amazon does not carry these and they are expensive at other online retailers.  I would suggest trying a can of Da Morgada, if you have a chance to pick up a can.",negative

"I was looking for a good decaf for health reasons.  Because I have liked the flavor of other Seattle's Best and since most of the reviews were favorable, I tried it. It was so bitter and ""off"" tasting, I couldn't finish it.  I even tried again with adjustments but couldn't drink it.  I don't know if I possibly got a bad (not so fresh) batch but it's non-refundable, so I wasted my money.",negative

"This story about three women is a very sensitive study about: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans) who is about 37 and Martha (Frieda Pittors) the oldest who is the mother of Muriël. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriël comes from a village and wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl. In fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something - for instances an accident - which could dramatize this story. As times goes on, you discover that the director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more. This movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case, so one is left with a feeling of emptiness.",negative
"Pleasant, enjoyable taste and aroma. This brand has been the best tasting of the many natural hibiscus teas I've tried so far. I prepare/enjoy it hot and also serve it over ice as an herbal iced tea.",positive
"The 2 star rating is because the seller says that you will receive 5 pounds, yet they show you a 5 GALLON container. Please look close before you buy. I have been buying Hard Winter Wheat seeds for YEARS. The container displayed for this item appears, especially when compared to others selling a 5 gallon containers of Wheatgrass seeds, to be a 5 gallon pail. yet with this item you get only 5 pounds. 5 pounds of hard wheat seeds will not even come close to filling a 5 gallon pail. Every time I have bought a 5 gallon container of Wheatgrass Seeds it has had 35 pounds of Wheatgrass seeds in it, NOT 5 POUNDS.The Sprout House may very well have a high quality seed, but deceiving the buying public, in my opinion, is wrong and needs to be addressed and revealed, hopefully before even one person is deceived. An experienced wheat grass seed purchaser would not be deceived, but a first time purchaser of hard wheat seed might be. How many times have you, as a first time purchaser of something, bought an item only to be disappointed because what was pictured, what you expected to receive, is not what you actually did receive. There are many people that prey on the ignorance or naivety of a first time buyer and use that to sell them something, and when it is received it is not what was pictured or what was expected. It is the first time purchaser that is new to a market that is the easiest to deceive. It is that type of buyer this review is meant to protect.If you search for hard wheat seed on Amazon you will see other HONEST companies selling containers that look EXACTLY like this one that contain 35 pounds and not 5 pounds of seed, and the cost per pound is much closer to what it should be than this 5 pound container is. Maybe this was an honest mistake and not intentional. If that is the case, I am sure the mistake will be corrected. If I see that it is corrected I will modify or delete this review. But PLEASE, always do your research before you buy so what you expect to receive is what you do receive.",negative
very strange tasting...like sweet onions ...i like it.....,positive
"I'm an avid drinker of a famous coffee retailer, and I routinely use a creamer in its coffee to blunt the acidic aftertaste. I recently read about civet coffee and it peaked my interest. I Googled and found varying prices, and this particular seller/distributor was reasonably priced. I tried it...I loved it!! It's very smooth and no need for a creamer; just follow the directions to a tee. And don't think about what you're actually drinking... ;)",positive
I don’t recommend it at all. It taste horrible. I would never buy this again. Paper thin. Crumbles. Not worth the money spent.,negative

In my pics I show you the difference between this hibiscus snacks and my fav that I always buy by another brand, the color should tell you all. Don’t waste your money",negative
"These are a fun family activity.  We enjoyed selecting a variety of naturally and synthetically sour foods with our children, and then trying them with the frooties.  Just use moderation with how much sour food you eat, even though your tastebuds can't detect the sour, both your stomach and your lips can.  My husband also used these in a young men's activity for our church.  They were discussing the five basic tastes in their cooking class, and as a conclusion to the activity they experienced the frooties effect on sour foods.  It was very popular, and the youth enjoyed the experiment.",positive

Mial4023 is the person I purchased the cookies from. Delicious classic cookies found again!They were NOT a gift. so I ordered them on eBay but they were shipped from Amazon, categorized as a gift.

"These seeds do produce very good broccoli sprouts. it is clearly evident the sulforaphane produced is very high. This is evident from the powerful sulporaphane odor. However, the yield that sprouts is around half of the seeds.The low yield has a side effect of seeds that start to rot in about the same time as it takes the seeds to sprout.The instructions are to soak the seeds for a certain number of hours before starting the sprouting. I use a system which is supposed to eliminate the need for presoaking and it has proved to work well. So, I used it without presoak and discovered the rotting problem. I then tried the prescribed presoak with the tray system I use and with traditional bottles with screen tops. All have the same results. I used one soaked seed per location placed in a 10 by 10 array of seeds on wet paper towel. 47 out of 100 sprouted. I did not repeat the test.The traditional bottle method is useful to rinse the sprouts very thoroughly to keep a build up of slime out of the bottle. After the sprouting is completed a colander needs to be used to since away the unsprouted seeds. The end result is good sprouts.A bit of extra work and a poor yield, but the end result is good sprouts which should be very healthy as evidenced by the strong odor throughout the process.Addition to my review. I am successfully sprouting lots of different seeds. But this bag of Brocoli seeds is being discarded because the percentage of seeds sprouting is entirely too low. The seeds which do not sprout simply degrade and contaminate the few which do not sprout.",negative

"I bake often and was looking for a good quality organic pastry flower. I ordered Arrowhead Mills Organic Pastry flour expecting just that. I have used other products from this company in the past and have been happy.  I was quite disappointed when I received whole grain flour in my package. Whole grain and delicate pastry simply do not mix in my kitchen.  I tried the flour anyway but it was so grainy that my pie crust cracked and broke while it was baking. I have been baking pies since I was a child; this has never happened to my pies in the past. The crust was also a quite unpleasant brown color before I placed it into the oven. The item description states simply organic pastry flour. The photo of the bag shows in large print, “organic pastry flour.” It wasn’t until I received the item and was able to read the fine print that I saw that this was a whole grain product. The questions and reviews are of no help, as they are mixed with all sorts of other Arrowhead Mills products ranging from gluten free to rye flours.Quite annoyed to be stuck with six bags of this useless flour and no way to return due to the no returns policy on food items.",negative
Very good coffee and a great service,positive
"I have purchased these sparkling IZZE juices many times.  I have never been disappointed.  The juices have a crisp refreshing flavor that I love.  They are 70% fruit juices with no added sugars or preservatives.  I was a diet Coke junkie until I found these on Amazon. Also, I have priced the IZZE juices in the regular super market, and Amazon has the best value.",positive
Love them color vase delivery great,positive
"Excellent potato salad.  You can really taste the potatoes and not just pickles, mustard and mayo.  Great.",positive
"Super product, consistently good.",positive
Everyone loves the flavor of these sparking drinks!  Yum!,positive
Great ice pops!,positive
"By themselves, obviously they taste very plain. But chop up a banana a drizzle some honey and they are delicious! Not as good as corn puffs, but a healthier option for sure",positive
To keep hydrated in the hot summer hours.Easy to use great taste.,positive
"Just not good. Actually,  tastes ok, but its a flimsy,  sloppy mess. I even bought a pizza grate so I could follow the instructions on the box. Still a waste. If you don't mind eating with a big spoon, you might like it. Otherwise,  move on.",negative
Terrible tasting. Not much more to say.,negative
These are a family favorite! Quick and easy with great taste. 👍,positive
My husband has been drinking this coffee for over 40 years,positive
"Cancelled my order within just a few hours from a weekend night to the next morning.  Order was still processed a day later and isn't supposed to arrive until 10 days later. Curious on how that works to still process a cancelled order and with it being boxed microwave popcorn, no return.  Good for you.  You still got the money.",negative
"The color is impressive....deep, dark, rich looking...The aroma is heavenly and strongly smells of cinnamon.And it's one of the few powdered cinnamons that actually tastes as rich as it looks...I've been disappointedtoo many times with flat tasting cinnamon...I love cinnamon and I want to taste it when I bake somethingwhere cinnamon should be prominent.  I'm not 100% sure what Vietnamese cinnamon is...whether it'sthe healthiest cinnamon I could have purchased...But I've tried so many different types...and this is clearlyone of the ones I'd recommend for flavor...deep intense cinnamon flavor...It's not overly spicy....it's almostnaturally sweet tasting right out of the jar.  It is on the expensive side but the flavor is worth it to me.4/23/21I just came back to order another bottle...just didn't want to spend so much money.  I went to Penzy's website...You all should really check out the price Penzy's charges for 1/2 cup of this cinnamon....$7.95 and free shipping if you order $39 worth of products...So that is what I did....For $41.00 I not only got the largest size  cinnamon which was a great big BAG, and 3 whole cups....they sell jars on their websiteif you buy bagged spices and want to store in it your own jar...Penzy's is great place to browse and much cheaper than buying 1/2 cup of cinnamon on Amazon where shipping is costing more than the cinnamon itself, giving the illusion this should cost this much.. ....Here it just looks like insanely expensive jar of cinnamon which it really is not! I use so much cinnamon that I had to find a more cost effective way to buy this...I love it...it's truly the very best cinnamon I've ever tasted...And now I'm going to have 3 cups ofcinnamon for a much better price!!",positive
"I’ve had 4 different flavors of this ravioli. All delicious and easy to prepare. Definitely follow directions and use handheld strainer to remove once ready. Don’t dump as you do with regular pasta. The ravioli will break open if you do. That’s how fresh and delicate the pasta is.Enjoyed with just EVOO and or butter with little S&P, basil and parm. Also have done with pasta sauce.  So delicious either way.They freeze well if you don’t use right away and wanna cook later.",positive
Nooooooo haha this is soooo small for 10$ ridiculously small .,negative
"The whole batch that we received was moldy (see the pic). Absolutely inedible. We were so excited to have some kosher meat protein snack with us on a road trip - so obviously that never happened.Hoping to get a good replacement or a full refund.Update a few days later: the customer support is great at least, they responded promptly and handled the situation. I hope to be able to order this product in the future!",negative
haha I just playing,neutral
I agree with m any other reviewers - great taste but am finding grit in my food.  Not sure whether I'll keep using it.,negative

This product was recommended by our dentist. You can suck on them all you want without ruining you teeth. In fact it’s good for the health of your teeth. Thank you,positive
Did not care for the texture and strong flavor.,negative
Decent flavor and texture,positive
I sent these as a gift. My mother said that they were stale. Not worth the $17. Very disappointed!,negative
Love the basket but could of use more fruit,negative
"I've recently been making my own very quick and simple salad dressings made of 1 part fruit infused balsamic and 1 part fruit infused olive oil. This is my very favorite. The Blood Orange mixed with either raspberry or blueberry balsamic is great over spring greens, followed by a dusting of goat cheese. Simple and elegant and best of all, delicious.",positive
"I love the taste, and the absence of sugar. Tropical punch is my favorite",positive
I learned the hard way there are many olive oils out there claiming to be cold pressed extra virgin but turn out to NOT be what they claim.  These folks give the details of the oil so if you are looking for more polyphenols for health reasons these folks will ensure you get the real oil with the tell tale peppery taste at the back of your throat which tells you its real.  Purchase from theme with confidence you are getting what you are looking for and not some substandard fake.,positive
"I am thoroughly impressed with this quinoa. It tastes great, there is no miscellaneous material (sticks, rocks, etc), and it's a  great value. This is my third 25 lb bag. Thanks!",positive
"Not even in a box or wrapped, came in a baggie, with most of the boxes smashed or opened,",negative
Hard to choke down. They claim to be an all natural protein bar but the blueberry flavor they add is so fake it will make you sick.,negative
"I really like this coffee. It was very good. Crossed it off my bucket list.It wasn't a life changer though. I did drink a beverage that has passed thru a cat's bowels, so there is that!",positive
OMW! Once you taste this you will not stop eating it! yummmmmmmmm add brown sugar and hint of vanilla,positive
These were very good. Package was a little small for the money but definitely would purchase again,positive
"My 13 yr old just loves this bar! We had the sample of the chocolate chip and I was told it's like eating fresh cookie dough but without getting into trouble! Two big thumbs up, I just ordered a box 👍👍",positive
"I took a chance in trying this tea.  I typically like Long Jing and similar Chinese, as well as Sencha.  This has a kind of musky taste, somewhat like a weaker Oolong.  I won't buy again.",negative
Second order.  Love these multipacks.,positive
This brand of relish is very tasty. I use it frequently and appreciate it. I will purchase it again I recommend it,positive
Enjoying this blend very much,positive
Very consistent high-quality hazelnuts with no broken shells. The backyard squirrels are loving them!,positive
"These are absolutely delicious! Kudos, Hershey's, for making a sugar-free option that doesn't taste fake!!",positive
"Love this coffee. I don't remember drinking any other coffee at home, ever. One canister costs less than a couple of Starbucks fancy drinks. And it smells so good, too.",positive
"Probably the greasiest hash out there, i can't say it has much flavor compared to other brands. Will not buy again.. 90% fat per can is excessive.",negative
"I bought a small bag at first.... we fell in love with those candies immediately, so we ended up buying in bulk. Those candies are truly delicious, and they leave an exquisite after-taste. The people at this company were amazing, great customer service... and absolutely amazing products, authentic Italian stuff. We bought several types of their candies, and we really love them all! We bought every kind of their Perle di Sole products, plus all the Dufour products, and all of them are really delicious! We can not wait to see what other new products they will bring for Christmas! They are truly legit! Thank you, Sweet Imports for all your dedication, exceptional customer service and the most authentic products!",positive
Could tell right away this is superior coconut oil....smooth & rich....will reorder....thanks!,positive
"We received the order with all the disc broken, and the candy inside were tasteless. Old candy unable to consume.",negative
This is essential for a proper gumbo. Tried to buy it locally but could not find it. This was a simple way for getting the File',positive
"Tacos are utterly out of the question if you try to use these abominations. As soon as you try folding one over to spoon in your taco blend it will break, guaranteed. Also, they taste like cardboard and have a texture akin to the same. These are worthless and I am sorry I wasted my money on them.",negative
love the spice mix.  use on wild game as well as domestic beef.,positive
Nice rich tomatoes. Perfect for your recipes esp as a pizza sauce. Crush by hand and use,positive
I used this product as a splurge for my sweet tooth.. delicious..🤤,positive
So good! I’ve only been adding one serving to my shakes for a flavor change but I love it. It makes adding PB to a shaker bottle possible.,positive
Love this - very smokey and great on a variety of foods!!,positive
Easy to add to Paleo cookies and tortillas,positive
"This is very good oolong tea.  It took me awhile to develop a taste for cold oolong, but now I can honestly say that there is nothing better on a hot summer day than this tea as cold as you can get it!",positive
The MOST DELICIOUS CHIPS EVER.,positive
"I have drank more than my share of orange juice over my lifetime and I just didn't believe it until I saw it. This juice is watered down, just let it sit in your refrigerator for a day or two and you will see all the water in the product. Fresh squeezed is heavier than water, so it sinks to the bottom. The new American way beat the American Public.",negative
"Love this Dark Magic Dark Roast both for the quality, taste AND price! I'm a little bit of a coffee addict...okay a lotta bit. Lol. I have tried almost every type of coffee that's available in the kcups. This has been, by far, one of the most consistently strong yet smooth coffee I've tasted. Sometimes I'll drink it just black and sometimes with a bit of creamer. Tastes amazing and gives me that extra kick I need to get my day started. Read so many reviews before buying this and I'm glad to say I have no regrets!",positive
Omg these are absolutely the best butter pecan cookies I've ever had!!! Thank you!!!,positive
Great product arrived fast!! highly recommended,positive
The product packaging made me think it is 100% coconut but it is not. It does not even show how much coconut is in it. It has absolutely no taste at all. It does not taste like coconut nor smell like coconut. Not even a little bit. Worst tasting coconut drink I ever had. I have no idea what is in it.,negative
Fabulous deal,positive
I love Sara Beth’s jam.,positive
I don't think I even need to say anything!  These are wonderful and they came with a cool pack so no melting 👼,positive
"you know when you out running errands and you start getting the hungriness. you drive by 30 fast food restaurants knowing its easy. well break the habit by putting this in you purse/murse and have a thermos of water- your set. I didn't realize it was two servings per bar- sill better that a burger and fries-I also keep them in my work locker, the area is climate controlled, so no worry about early spoilage due to heat.the Taste to me is great- I love coconut and the almond bits give a variety to the texture. I am truly full when I eat a whole bar- perhaps I could try to cut down to half a bar and see if it will still do the job. Strongly recommend a full bottle of water with it.",positive
I wish there were 40 different pods like you get with the bold roast.,positive
"It tasted like Nesquik chocolate milk and I drank it all, the end.",positive
My husband loves this ramen. I’m happy it is back in stock.,positive
this is the best Sparkling Ice falavor made.  It tastes a bit like orange juice with soda.  It's great.  Have reordered 10 times now.,positive
Read a lot of terrible reviews but purchased anyways and I’m glad I did.... sent them as a Mother’s Day gift and she LOVED them.,positive
"We love butter pecan but this tastes NOTHING like butter pecan. We love Torani syrups but this one is a dud. Also, beware on allergies, there is no pecans in this, only peanuts! It tastes like straight up sweet boiled peanuts",negative
"So, what do I have to say about this? Well it seems looking at other reviews down the list, that I am NOT alone in my dissatisfaction in this product. The cranberry and grapefruit juices were okay, but certainly did not taste that fresh. EVEN THOUGH the expiration date was July of 2022 and I received these in February 2022. But the REAL kicker was the OJ. I took a big swig of the 1st bottle and immediately regretted it. It tasted like it had started to ferment. Upon further inspection, ALL of them had gone bad in the same way. One even spewed like a can of soda that had been shaken when opening it. I do not know if it was a manufacturer's issue or if it just sits in an unrefrigerated warehouse for too long. But I WILL not buy this again. As a side note, I also gave this a bad review also because I had to talk to 4 Amazon customer service reps before I was FINALLY granted a refund. The middle two said that it was not returnable and no refund could be issued. And the 3rd one even had the audacity to suggest that I ""simply"" call the manufacturer and see what they could do for me. Also... stating that I needed to have taken a picture of the expiration date on the bottle for me to even have a chance of Amazon resolving the issue. The last rep I spoke with, Walker D.  was understanding and gave me a refund without question or hassle. This is why I love shopping on Amazon most of the time. But I digress...... I do NOT recommend this product and I am surprised that it has as high a rating as it does. Buy with caution.",negative
"Given the fact this coffee has received mostly negative reviews here, I decided to pinch it with mine, considering the fact that a review of coffee is totally useless for the simple fact that it is something that relates to personal taste, and therefore, no objective qualities can be derived from it, making any review, negative or positive, yours or mine, again, just useless.Anyway, I just wanted to say that we have tried almost all of the Starbucks whole beans coffee available for drip machines and this is the one we like the most. After this we like Pike, which is the 'regular joe' you get when you go to Starbucks. We have also tried other brands, including some very very expensive ones, local and otherwise. Still we like Starbucks Breakfast Blend the most. For drip coffee with our Bonavita machine ([[ASIN:B00SK5IXPQ Bonavita BV1500TS 5-Cup Carafe Coffee Brewer, Stainless Steel]]). We also enjoy Nespresso for espresso.So there you have it, my useless review trying to compensate the mostly negative and also useless reviews here.Thanks!",positive

Definitely a value for money and I love the real deal when it's honey,positive
"First of all these must be used as seeds, 100 beans is not enough to make a meal with and they were very expensive!. I have not used them for this reason, so I don't know how they taste in a dish .",positive
"If you like mints, I think you will like these, but if you've never had them before, you should probably go to the store and spend the extra dollar on a single tin before you go for this rather large box of mint tins.  I've loved these mints for years.  However, they do live up to their claim of being ""Curiously Strong Peppermints.""  The first couple you try if you've never had them before will shock you.  This is nothing like your Lifesavers(R) peppermint.  Those are very weak compared to these.  And the starlight kind really belong in the candy category, not the mint category.Also, the fact that they are in tins make them handy for carrying around, because they don't break like the plastic ones.",positive
"Great flavor,i have yet to be disappointed ordering sausages from amazon always  happy with my purchase, only thing i might become addicted .",positive
Well I would give it more stars but I never got the email for the credit,negative
This is the best chai I have found on Amazon.  It is the perfect strength of black tea with spices. Other teas do not have enough of the spices in them - probably because some of the spices can be expensive.,positive
I have had a hard time finding an energy drink that gives me the energy I want without a lot of the other yucky stuff that can be in different types of drinks. Definitely love this one.,positive
I got this for my husband for Christmas or his birthday which is the day before.He is extremely hard to please and I think this was his favorite gift. He shared a little and it was so delicious. I would buy again.,positive

This is a great tea,positive
very garlicky,positive
This product was given as a gift to my wife and she really enjoys it however in our little town I could not find it so ordered it through  Amazon.com  and had it conveniently delivered. My wife is Happy,positive
[[VIDEOID:33b1cc82784847aa973923ac4ba838bf]] Only ever used wilton or icing inks but these worked in a pinch.  The color wasn't vibrant but I guess that's to be expected when printing on fondant?  Item was relatively undamaged however alot of pages were broken at the very edges.,positive
My favorite keto tea!!,positive
"This is my second time trying this product- once several years ago when I was doing paleo and last week while I’ve been doing low carb. The noodles looked and tasted just fine, could totally be a good pasta substitute. But the last time and this time, this product tears my stomach UP. I had these several days ago and I am STILL recovering from what it did to my gut. I really wanted to like and use these but I guess my system can’t handle it. That’s the only reason I would recommend these with caution. Hopefully this works for others but it doesn’t work for me.",negative
"I have enjoyed this soup for years, and have purchased several 12-packs through Amazon.  When I started eating the first carton from my latest purchase, I knew immediately something had changed, and not for the better.  The texture was all wrong and the soup tasted too sweet.I checked the label and was disgusted to learn that the soup now contains 9 grams of sugar (versus 3), and only 8 grams of protein, compared to 12 previously.  In addition, the fat content is 1/3 higher and there are 10 additional calories.I pitched the 11 remaining cartons of soup, and I will never purchase a Nile Spice product again.  I notice that the current product Amazon is listing shows the OLD nutrition information.  Something tells me this is so much baloney.",negative
I love these chia seeds in my oatmeal for breakfast!!  They give a slight crunch to fruit and other foods.  These seeds are very healthy especially for the colon.  Love having this 2 pound bag in my refrigerator....it is the FINEST!!,positive
These are so good! Squeaky just like I remembered and perfect for snacking or your poutine cravings! These kept well in the fridge for a while. Will definitely be ordering more.,positive
Only one bag sent when three bags were advertised.,negative
Use it at a healthful snack,positive
Was extremely disappointed. They smelled so bad (rather fishy) and felt like chewing rubber. Was unable to eat them and had to throw them away.,negative
Kind of expensive for what you get but the tea is good.,positive

"good product, nice and powdery, great taste!",positive
I really appreciate the glass jar. I use it everyday. Would recommend this brand. Super smooth on the skin and hair and tastes so good in my coffee blended in the mornings.,positive

This is unacceptable! I received loose k cups in a plain brown box. That makes me leery of if this is legit.,negative

"I love these corn chips. They have a great light yet crunchy flavor. They have just enough ""kick"" to them.",positive
"Good flavor, quite spicy.  The box that it was packaged in arrived with the bottom of the box cut off so basically the boxes of crackers/tuna were at risk of being damaged or stolen.  Anyone could have taken the top of the brown box off and helped themselves to the snacks.  It looked like it was taken off of a shelf and just covered over with the box so it could ship.",positive
The Best of the Best!  Zero Calories and no after taste! You just need a drop in your coffe for a delicious and smooth tasting Mocha flavor!So happy I found this bottle of cocoa syrup!

These are delicious!!! Highly recommend!,positive
A very tasty confection. I would order this again.,positive
"Much better than the poptarts my coworkers down with a.m. coffee.  I keep these available at all times because I AM tempted by fast food and don't have admirable will power.  I was on subscription before but stopped because of freshness issues.  These have become more popular now so the issues seem to have been fixed.  Now back on subscription.  Side note- I prefer the non fruit options.  They are too sweet for me, unbelievably.",positive
"AWESOME!!  It's pricey for me, but, I saw and felt a huge difference....this product combined with Aloe Vera Juice and Cloraphyl has, increased my overall health and I DO have a LOT of serious health issues that doctors for 7 years have said ""Let's just ""watch it"" grow.....THEN we will do the necessary surgeries.  Well, since the last sentence they say ""watch"" I said since your eyesight is so good....""Watch me as I walk out the door!""  And started with a colon cleanse, then maintain with the above  products I am using.  I have a rectum and pelvic prolapse and the Noni Mangosteen Goji Acai Juice along with the other products has made a significant positive change.  I will still need surgery very soon, but, I decided not to wait any longer and went out on my own research and trial and am very happy with the results. Not ""healed"" yet, but, the juice(s) and being sure I keep up with the enemas (the only way for me to eliminate) have certainly made things easier until we actually get all of this surgically resolved.  I guarantee (at least my own opinion) anybody would be happy with this product.....if they can afford it, they will be back for re-orders!",positive
"Endorphin chilihead. That's what I am and Dave's Scorpion sauce is it! I feel the release of endorphins. I use about 1/4 t on many things. I love the sensation. My eyes get big, I become very alert, and I enjoy the tingling. One thing I've done is put some of [[ASIN:B00DGWTIC0 Dave's Gourmet Scorpion Pepper Hot Sauce, 5 oz]] in a mason jar of water. I use cellophane to cover and a mason jar lid ring. Then insert a straw through the cellophane and drink. I get the sensation without eating food. Pure chilihead delight. *the reason for the cellophane is because the fumes from the scorpion flavored water are tough to breathe. I have Dave's ghost pepper sauce as well. The scorpion sauce is superior in flavor. The ghost pepper sauce is good but this scorpion pepper sauce is excellent! It's over 1 million Scoville units, so beware. My tolerance has increased over time. I'm ready to try a sauce with the Carolina Reaper in it.",positive
Found this product in a store and fell in love. Couldn't find it but lucky for me it was available on Amazon. Definitely give it a try if you are looking for a relatively healthy snack.,positive
"I bought this tea at a local store that doesn’t carry the same products so I ordered it here. The package was completely broken and destroyed. Then, the flavor was so weak and not even comparable to the local box I bought. I assume the tea sent to me is stale. Also, cannot be returned. So disappointed.",negative
"I orginally found Hot Squeeze at a gourmet food expo in Memphis and bought one bottle.  Before the expo was over, I had bought a second bottle.  Our favorite way to use it is on baked salmon, but we use it in many other ways too:  on eggs, poured over cream cheese as an appetizer, and on chicken wings.",positive
"My husband loves this sauce, because it’s not too hot and has a good flavor. He uses it on many different food items.I haven’t been able to find it in the store lately, so I appreciate being able to order it on line.",positive

I have been looking for these Chocolate chips with coconut cookies for a long time.  I love them!!  I did find these a little pricey  though.  That is the  reason I gave them the rating.,positive
excellent taste NO MSG!  Buy it often!,positive
"I remember that the first batch of these cookies I ever got was in my Christmas stocking. I cracked into them excitedly with a buddy of mine. The taste was so awful I assume its what Santa is giving bad kids instead of coal nowadays. My gut was ravaged and I retched so hard I killed myself in Call of Duty. Granted this was two years ago but the taste haunts me so badly that I felt compelled to warn others. However, if you are seeing to punish some unsuspecting schmuck these cookies are the best hence the 5 stars. They look and smell palatable but taste like spoiled  milk and eggs, paired with rancid butter. My stomach and throat ache at the memory of that fateful day. They sure made an impression causing me to gag every time I pass them in the store which is what prompted this review. Please be aware of what you are purchasing before it is too late.",positive
This brand used to be my favorite. Until they reformulated. Why on earth they would take the best natural taste on the market and mess with it is beyond comprehension. I used to buy this product in large quantities. I returned all 12 of my most recent purchase from a local grocery store. The taste is now horrible--horribly artificial.  I'm so disappointed in this brand. They had a good thing and chose to ruin it. I grew up in the Caribbean and know what coconut water is supposed to taste like--this is not it. Their original taste was the closest to the real thing but no more.  Wish I could give it zero stars.,negative
Price is unbeatable. Coffee is great,positive

This us a great flavor and price right.,positive
"We purchased this product to use for making movie theater style popcorn at home and let me tell you it does not disappoint.  It really does make all the difference when you are trying to recreate that movie theater experience at home.  Has a great buttery flavor and rich color.  When we ran out we used regular coconut oil and, WOW, the taste was just not the same.  We host movie nights at our house quite often and then helps us stay within our budget while giving us the WOW factor to our guests.",positive
Box was damaged and bag of nut were open and nuts were all over the box.,negative

"The flavor is awesome. Second time I bought them. There is mold growing in there this time. Jars been open a month, and in the fridge. Pulled it out and saw the hair growing. Weird that it would mold in the fridge.Hopefully it was just a one off. Will update if second jar does the same.",negative
It arrived broken. Obviously I can't use it because of the broken pieces of glass in it.,negative

Do you like spicy? Then you will definitely love this flavor. Wonderful tea with just the right touch of spice. Will order again.,positive
"We love rye bread and bake our own; these McCormick caraway seeds are the equal of any brands we've tried, and a lot cheaper than many.  They're fragrant, flavorful, uniform in size and color, and thoroughly cleaned.  The sixteen ounce size is a good compromise: it holds quite a bit but still fits on a kitchen cabinet shelf.  It's stamped with a 'best-by' date.  Ours is 3-1/2 yrs from the review date.  The container is sturdy, with molded-in hand-grips; the lid is sectioned to allow sprinkling or measuring, and it unscrews as well.  You're not likely to tear a fingernail opening the lid; the sections push up pretty readily with your thumb.  And when empty, the containers can be repurposed for storing other bulk products (e.g., products that come in ""convenient, resealable pouches"" that are in fact, quite inconvenient and impossible to reseal).",positive
"This cereal is very close in consistency and flavor of cocoa crispies which I used to eat as a kid way back when! While I usually eat more plain tasting cereal, than are filled with carbs, I do find this pretty tasty and satisfying. The macro breakdown seems pretty good, so if on a kept or low carb diet, it's worth a shot. My wife really like the flavor.Not sure if I would generally spend $12 for a box of cereal, but it seems like these low carb products run around the same price.Overall, I enjoy this cereal!",positive
Tasted really stale. Not sure how long before it was packed.,negative
All flavors are great! Perfect when you want something besides plain water!,positive
I don't drink Soda or other carbonated beverages so my go to drink is Iced Tea. I love these Lipton K-Cups. The 12 oz brew is pretty strong so I can serve it over ice with more water added and still achieve a delicious Iced Tea.,positive

This coffee is amazing! The smell fills the room when brewing and it really does taste like blueberry cobbler. I'm definitely going to buy this again.,positive
I didn't care for the price but I really like this product.,positive
It needs a lot more chocolate.,negative
Best spice for hamburgers or pork chops. I can’t find it in the stores so I was excited to be able to get it from Amazon!!!,positive
It's the best coffee ever.  Just like it always has been.,positive
Love this product for gravies!,positive
"Love, love, love this stuff and I'm glad I found it on Amazon!",positive

"[[ASIN:B00112CND8 Multi-Blend Gluten Free Flour - 3lb]]If you miss baked-good recipes which were based on all purpose wheat flour then you must try this product. The manufacturer recommends that you replace each cup of all purpose wheat flour with 3/4 cup of the Multi-Blend Gluten Free Flour. I was quite skeptical because of earlier disappointments with gluten free products. To try the product I used my favorite corn bread recipe (old fashioned New England style with low fat/low sugar). When the corn bread came out of the oven it looked exactly like the corn bread I would make with wheat flour. The taste and consistency of the gluten free corn bread was equal to or better than the wheat based recipe. It was also as light as the wheat based recipe. On the down side this flour does not work with wheat based recipes for yeast breads. The manufacturer indicates that you should try gluten free recipes for yeast breads. I need to do some more research on gluten free recipes for yeast breads. If I find recipes that I like, I will note them here.",positive
"This syrup is pretty good on its own, but it really shines when added to the Torani Pineapple Syrup for a pina colada flavor.",positive
"I really like the taste in my green smoothie, but wish these came in larger sizes since I use so much of it.",positive
"I use this flour mostly  to make potato pancakes. I add it to mashed potatoes and bake it for about 20 minutes and I have delicious gluten free pancakes! It also works great for French fries and hash browns, just added to the potatoes before cooking...",positive
Good quality.  Know what you are getting.  No bad surprises!,positive
Not very good tamales. Not nearly as good as Tortilla Land.,negative

Pea soup,positive
The ginger taste is great and is more than candy. They help to soothe an upset stomach. My family really enjoys them.,positive
"Two flavors missing!  Unfortunately one was the one I really wanted, Chocolate Fudge cake. Then two of the flavors included were NOT Cake Boss Brand. They were Carlo's Bake Shop???",negative
"These are the Cadillac of ramen noodles. Well, I mean, it is still ramen after all and costs pennies per serving but the extra flavor packets included with these make all the difference. There is the typical dried power flavoring but also dried onion, chile seasoning, soy sauce and sesame oil included. They are delicious and I find myself reaching for them again and again to eat as a snack or as a base for other dishes.",positive
"Penzey's Vindaloo Seasoning was my husband's introduction to curry.  He doesn't like to try new flavors, but I ordered a bag of this along with some other things and one Saturday, made Pork Vindaloo according to the recipe on the bag.  It was an all afternoon project, but the house smelled amazing, and the result was, well, absolutely wonderful.  I take no credit, I just followed instructions.  Now, my husband regularly requests Vindaloo.  It's the perfect winter dish; spicy, rich, and soul satisfying.  Penzey's suggests using from 2-5 T of this.  We've found that 4 T is the perfect amount for our taste.You're going to need more than 1/4 cup of this, so just go ahead and order the big bag, and BTW, the Amazon price is crazy high.  Order from Penzey's website.  You're welcome.",positive
Arrived promptly. No Damage. Product fresh. I would recommend to his seller,positive
"Bright green color, great taste, great value for the price. Used it for iced matcha lattes. 10 oz of milk (1 tbs heavy cream, half cow milk, half reduced sugar almond milk), 1/2 tbs of honey, 1-1.5 tsp of matcha. Blend it or shake it. Pour into a glass. Add about 1/2 cup or more of ice. Enjoy!",positive
"I have to admit that after I received these little guys I didn't immediately pop them into milk like the instructions said...it was a few days later before I added them to the milk.I started out with a cup of milk in a mason jar with a piece of flannel cloth and a rubber band, and left a spoon in there so I could stir them periodically.  For about 4-5 days, nothing happened, and I worried they were DOA.  Then, I noticed they had bobbed up to the surface, and that's when I finally started noticing a change in both the smell and tangy taste of the milk to tell me that fermentation had occurred.Since then, they've performed exactly as advertised:  24 hrs or less on a counter in 2 cups of milk, and you've got kefir!  They are now so robust that I have to store them in the fridge as soon as I strain them and add to new milk, or the kefir will take over the house (along with my sourdough culture, Floyd - he will blow through a refreshment in a few hours on the counter!).  I now keep them with the mason jar lid loose in the refrigerator, and only put the jar out on the counter when I'm ready for more kefir, shaking the jar a couple of times during the day.  After half a day, the grains rise to the surface, and that's when I strain them.Since I bought the culture in December, and despite mostly storing the culture in the fridge, the little guys have now doubled in volume, so I can give some away.Price might seem $ for what is essentially a teaspoon of grains, but trust me, they will pay for themselves, and a little goes a long way (same with yogurt culture).  I saved the little container they came in when I pass some on to a friend.",positive
"This stuff was great! I'm a newbie to fondant and it was easy to use, easy to color and tasted pretty good.",positive
"Have eaten these for years. They are ok. Not like moms cooking. But will do in a pinch. Actually Amazon sent me the wrong product. They sent six Mac- cheese ones. I told them they sent the wrong ones, and they immediately sent out the beef and mashed potatoes. And let me keep the Mac-cheeses., recieved them within 24 hours, thanks Amazon!!!! Great service, prompt customer service.",positive
"I used these Safaroma saffron threads to add flavor and color to my rice today. I soaked the threads in water first, although you can add the threads directly to the rice when cooking it. I actually wanted to see how the threads colored the water. As you can see the yellow is beautiful. I added the saffron water to the rice while it was cooking and it came out delicious.The taste is hard to describe - sort or grassy and earthy but also slightly sweet. This saffron met my expectations and more. It is fresh and the glass bottle was well sealed when I received it. The price is fair since saffron is so labor intensive to harvest.  A little goes a long way too. You can use it in many different dishes, from savory to sweet.I will purchase this Safaroma saffron in the future.",positive
So yummy and great to spread on toast. So fresh you can taste the berries. Yum,positive
Excellent granola bars.,positive
A good addition to serve with Asian food.,positive
Dented can. Big dent.,negative
My daughter loves this! Saves on plastic waste by using pods instead of bulky Gatorade bottles. Smart idea from Gatorade!,positive
Great for a low carb lifestyle. They have a much better texture and taste than shirataki noodles (aka miracle noodles) and no fishy smell! Great for soups and pasta dishes.,positive
"Decent amount, doesnt make big cups but if youre looking for what flavor you like, get these and then buy the big  cases.",positive
"These are great SWEET PEAS right out of the can. MULTIPLE ORDERS with Amazon.The secret - order separately without any other big, heavy, items that can dent your cans",positive
"Surprisingly very good coffee. Pods are plastic, not aluminum.",positive
My mom always puts at least a spoonful when she makes her soups from scratch. It has great herbs that make her soups very tasty!,positive

"Comes in a sturdy, resealable bag (that SAYS on it to transfer to an air tight container. ??) These are the real Toor Dal.",positive
They were stale and hard and discolored. I had to throw all 3 boxes away,negative
"The spice is very fresh and a great addition to Korean and all Asian dishes. It is not the liquid paste condiment Gochugang, but one of the ingredients in that prepared sauce and many others. The pouch is resealable, and there is quite a lot to use. Not super duper spicy (which it shouldn’t be), more around a jalapeño than a habanero . It cooked great in a glaze for salmon from a recipe that was featured in the NYT.",positive
"This has a much smoother texture than any Halva I've ever tried, and tastes extremely fresh. My new favorite!",positive
"I initially felt the price for a bag of Cremosa Chupa Chups was on the high side. Despite this, I still placed my order. I changed my opinion about the price when the bag arrived. These are full size Chupa Chups lollipops-25 per bag and come in 2 flavors:  strawberries & cream and chocolate & vanilla. Both of these happen to be my favorite flavor Chupa lollipops. They're absolutely delicious, fresh and satisfy my 'sweet tooth'.  I might as well go ahead and confess that I selfishly hide this bag and keep it for myself and do not share. lol. I  know, I know. That's terrible. But I also purchase bags of 240-mini Chupa Chups for the rest of the family as well as customers who buy nail polish from me. (I always include some Chupa Chups with their polish purchases. )Chupa Chups are my favorite lollipops and I will continue to purchase them.",positive
"I bought this as a gift for my Dad for Father's Day and he loved it !! He has gone to France several times in his lifetime so I really wanted him to enjoy a taste of France for Father's Day.  Well, when I called him for Father's Day, he thanked me for the cheeses and said he really enjoyed them. Thank you for helping to make may Dad 's Father's Day special for him.",positive

"Last month I ordered St. Ignatius French Roast Coffee from Amazon and am now in my second bag. It is rich, deeply satisfying, and one of the best French Roast coffees I've drunk. Everyone in my house loves it! I'm back to place another Amazon order for more as I want to make sure I don't run out! I highly recommend it if you prefer a full-bodied taste to your coffee along with a top quality product.",positive
"I don't give very many five star reviews, because most stuff really isn't worth five stars.  It's just stuff.  For me to ""love"" a product, it's really got to solve a problem or make my life much more convenient or fun. The Cafejo portable K-Cup maker is beyond awesome -- it's transformed my life on the road.  I travel several times a month for my job and am addicted to K-Cups (decaf only, which makes me even more picky about my coffee).  Whoever designed this coffee maker should get a lifetime achievement award of some kind -- it slices, dices, and makes coffee like crazy.  It works with coffee pods as well as K-cups, which is nice because the pods stash a lot easier in a suitcase than the K-cups sometimes. I don't have one single bad thing to say about it, and I've used it regularly for quite some time now without a hitch.Here's some tips:- You can stash three K-cups inside the stem of the plunger.  Wrap the whole thing in a soft t-shirt and stuff it in a suitcase somewhere.- Throw an immersion heater and your favorite go cup in your suitcase, and you're ready to roll.- Be sure to rinse it off after use and let it dry with the plunger out, so it dries thoroughly.",positive
Love this candy will buy a lot more!,positive
What can I say? A lesson learned in not reading the reviews. A lot of the already posted reviews echo my complaints so if I had to put one here it would be the stunning lack of variety. More than half of the bag was lollipops. Enough said.,negative
Just like I remembered from my childhood.,positive
I got this to have at work and it's great because usually I need something sweet after lunch...and it is very sweet.  Even better is that I don't have to remember to bring milk or sugar or a spoon to work because it has everything in it!,positive
"A very good and tasty product, which I will order again.",positive
Perfect alternative to flowers for any man or woman who’s a jerky fan!,positive

"My sister-in-law introduced me to this tea.  I loved it so much, I immediately went to Amazon and bought more.  I love this Tea, you do not have to add sugar at all, it is perfect.  However, the price was way a little on the high side, you can find it cheaper.",positive
Very tasty coffee. I'd buy it again.,positive

After reading up about these I was intrigued by there history and was excited to try them out. Very interesting. I am addicted to the more common Black pepper corns so these are expanding my tastes,positive
Ive always liked ranch dressing and blue cheese dressing and the flavor for both are magnificent,positive
Quick shipping - good product,positive
"I put a handful of these candies in my candy dish.  Near the bottom, I unwrapped a light green apple flavored candy to find an ant imbedded in it.

Beautiful . BF mom will love them on her birthday.,positive
I have repurchased many times...They are always on my counter and I travel with them...I would say Im obsessed......if you like cinnamon these are a winner---,positive
Poor quality berries with no flavor.  Their quality has gone down each time I've ordered and this will be the last.  The customer service refused to resolve the problem and were rude about it.,negative
Delicious. 100% satisfied with purchase. Thanks,positive
"These were very fragrant and flavorful, and much larger than expected.  You could smell them as soon as I opened the amazon packaging, which was a great sign.  Also good to note- they were all larger than what is stated in the description.  Used them to make vanilla cupcakes and they provided a very strong vanilla flavor profile, which is exactly what I was looking for.",positive
Arrived with seal broken and paste oozing out :(,negative
"The list of ingredients on the small bottle are:  Sugar, spices, (including Red Pepper, thyme, and allspice), salt, onion and turmeric.  The big bottle lists only: Salt, spices, (including Red Pepper), DEXTROSE, CARAMEL COLOR, chives, and SULFITING AGENTS.  This is so wrong!  It is labeled as Perfect Pinch Caribbean Jerk Seasoning.  It has things in it I would never buy in my spices!  I feel cheated.  Those SULFITING AGENTS make this totally unconsumable for me.  It gives me head headaches.  I thought Perfect Pinch in the small bottle was the perfect finishing agent.  This is NOT THE SAME THING!  I could try to add thyme, allspice, and onion which are so necessary to the flavor, but I can't take out the allergy causing SULFITING AGENTS!!!  Is this truly a McCormick product, or a fake copy?  :(  The taste is so off putting, too.  How can a person get a refund on a product you have to open and TASTE once it is opened?  Since when does a seasoning require caramel coloring?  WHAT COLOR exactly did they use to turn it brown?????  IS IT EVEN VEGAN???  The original was...but this fake one, I don't know.  So, what does McCormick do?  Throw Spanish on the label below the English, and short us on the good flavor????  Is it the Spanish on the label that is the difference between the big bottle and the little bottle???  What a waste of money.  Into the compost heap it goes....oh WAIT!  It has those SULFITING AGENTS...I don't need that in my compost pile.  **sad sigh**  Bye the way, I have purchased large bottles of of McCormick spice seasonings, and they were NOT different at all.",negative
"I love this tea so much, but i will never order from on here again. I have prime and it took over a week to get, the box was smashed which is all not that bad. The worst thing was that the bags have a strong bitter smell that its never smelled like before with weird brown spots on the bag. Not sure if its old or what but i am not drinking it at all lol",negative
These are the best gummies in the world! And the tubes are the perfect size for one sitting - wish they were always available.,positive
"Very suspenseful, surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students flatlining themselves and then being resuscitated to share their experiences of death and what lies beyond. Joel Schumacher directs with some skill - creating some very eerie scenes as well as particularly beautiful ones. The visions of death are not what viewers might expect nor is that which awaits us all when we go - thanks to screenwriter Peter Filardi who really did an outstanding job coming up with this story. While the creativity of the story is impressive, the story has many holes as well, particularly in the logic department and believability factors. Notwithstanding all of that Flatliners is a good effective film because of the script, the direction which again is very surreal at times, and the acting which brings four very talented actors and William Baldwin together. This core of actors acts and reacts off each other very nicely. Keifer Sutherland does a very impressive job as the head of the group - the one who comes up with the idea to die and be born again. He also manages to portray a man- a young man - with a damaging, destructive secret from his past. Kevin Bacon is fine as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group. Oliver Platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fears. Platt has some really good lines and plays the paranoia well. Yes, Julia Roberts is here too and very good. the actors do best though by playing off each other and making us believe they are such good friends. I was duly impressed with much of Flatliners but more than anything else the story affected me the most. The scene with that dog hobbling around the street just one of those powerful images evoked as were many of the ""flashback"" scenes.",positive
I like that I had portable snack between breakfast and lunch.,positive
Great rich taste for decaf coffee.,positive

"I wanted jalapeño juice to put into my wine.  I love jalapeño wine.  But in nothing flat, I have used up all the juice in my sliced jalapeño jar I use for nachos.  I wanted a juice I could just put in my wine, but this liquid is oily.  Not clear and leaves an oily film.Very disappointed.",negative
"Hubby and I go through about a gallon of tea everyday all year long.  I grow spearmint, lemon balm, catnip and lemon verbena and blend my own. I freeze organic citrus peels.  I don't have the space to grow all the chamomile we'd use so I buy it.  A 16 oz bag lasts about 9 months. The flowers are clean.  The scent and flavor is excellent.",positive
"This is more like a processed cheese product than a cheese itself. It is bland, almost flavorless and has an unpleasant waxy texture that did not melt well. I would never recommend this product.",negative
"This is pretty close to Nutella. I love it, no big after taste, nice flavor. will for sure, buy this again. my kids and hubby even liked it!",positive

This arrived with a broken lid leaking in envelope,negative
"I loved it , honestly i was scared to try it and I hate spinach but this was so good I will definitely get this again only problem it’s a little pricey. Also if you don’t know what this is it has a little bit of spice I’m okay with it but I know some people can’t have spice",positive
This is the best starter. It is robust and comes with great instructions. We make bread and this has never let us down.,positive
Excellent. Wish it was cheaper but don't mind paying for the quality.Update:Thank God these aren't cheaper. I would weigh 500 pounds by now. I have received my third bar. I have a little piece every few nights as a treat. This chocolate bar is so good!!!!,positive

"The coffee is great, I have the chocolate pack. The pods suck. I have the Kurig 2 and when I brew the coffee the grounds overflow into my coffee cup. At first I thought it was because I was brewing them strong, but even when I don't chose that option the grounds end up in my coffee. This removes the convenience factor of buying the pods.",negative

This coffee is organic and has great flavor!,positive
Came with all the flavors shown justifies the Carmel and it actually really good,positive
"The coconut oil is lovely.  Nice and clean looking and smelling (some other reviews questioned these aspects).  The flavor is neither completely neutral nor overtly coconutty - perfect for an all-around oil that I use for sautéing and baking.  The large container works well for me, as I pull out a smaller amount and keep that in a jar near my stove, but getting the product out of the large bucket is very accessible and easy.  I'm very happy with this product and the price!",positive
Refreshing mint flavor then chocolate. Mmmm . . .,positive
"Possibly the best Cup A Soup ever!  Creamy, rich flavor.  It is pricey becauseit comes from England, but is worth the price.  Even has eye appeal with prettygreen flecks of leeks in it.  I highly recommend you try this one.",positive

"These Organic Cocoa Butter drops are like super-sized white chocolate chips in terms of shape. They are uniformly sized/shaped, perfect for adding to a cup of coffee, or melting to incorporate into soaps or foods or candies. Previous to this product, I had ordered a different brand for my chocolate making endeavors which had come in large irregular chunks. This uniform sized product is making my chocolates easier to make with more successful outcomes. I have two more bags of the Wild Cocoa Butter in my pantry, I like them so much!",positive

"This basket was a gift for my father-in-law and after reading some of the other reviews for some of the smaller baskets - i was a bit nervous. Fear not! This basket is absolutely gorgeous, and loaded to the brim. The basket itself is very well put together and surprisingly weighty, so it doesn't come off as cheap. The smell of all of the items is reminiscent of a Bed and Breakfast in northern Vermont, and the birch even retained  bit of the natural smell. I think the prized centerpiece of the basket is the stoneware syrup jar with the swing top lid - classic and reusable.The smaller baskets may have dissapointed others - but the 8-piece is worth every penny!",positive
Tastes like a pound of salt. Not one hint of curry taste to this!,negative
"Received 3-can package yesterday.  Made the tea this morning and it is disappointing.  Looks like it is not as fresh, maybe on the shelf too  long.The jasmine fragrance isn't there at all.

Just awful. Guess my nostalgia got the best of me.,negative
Macro nutrition is on point for my needs anyway.  Taste exceeded expectations.  Snickerdoodle protein almond spread is off the chain - ridiculously good.  If your a endurance athlete who has trained to burn fat for fuel this should be something you pack to meet your nutritional needs.  Ditch the sugary goo's and gels that just spike your insulin levels.  This stuff is fantastic.,positive
Love this almond flour...the texture is great & an absolute must on any Keto diet! The price is good for the amount you get!,positive

"Finally - beef ribs and chicken with Mr, Yoshida's.  We used to buy this at BJs but they stopped stocking it.  Can't find it at WalMart or anywhere local.  found it on Amazon and stocked up on two large bottles.  We'll be okay for a bit but will reorder in the future.  Adds a delicious extra to ribs and chicken without the overwhelming, heaviness of a barbeque sauce.  Can be used to marinade as well.",positive
We put this on everything. We also love this company too. Watch the documentary on the man that started the company. He’s amazing!,positive

"I was very excited to get this as a gift this Christmas. Always wanted one of these tower goodie things. But the nuts were stale at best and some were even rancid(almonds, Brazil nuts). The fruit, it was very flavorless and had a bunch of sugar added, especially the papayas and kiwi(also, are those particular fruit processed with food coloring? Because they were very neon). The pear and peach weren't too bad, just lackluster, but I almost cracked a tooth on part of a peach pit. There are definitely better, fresher, tastier assortments available for way less. Not worth the 50 bucks that got shelled out for this.",negative
Contains Sucralose which affected the flavor negatively,negative

"I decided to try this turkey (which I bought at a local Popeyes) for the first time, and hoped it would be OK.My family was floored with the juiciness of this bird.  I never ever eat turkey breast because it's always much too dry.  But, on this turkey, the white meat was actually juicier than the dark meat!  They have injected turkey broth directly into the turkey and it has had time to infuse the entire bird.  The white meat was indescribably juicy, tender, and flavorful.  I'm actually going to see if there are any left and buy another one just to have whenever I feel like doing another turkey.  They are fully cooked, so you just thaw it in your fridge for 2-3 days and pop it in the oven to heat.  We covered with foil and then removed the foil at the last 15 minutes to crisp up the skin.The $39.95 price tag may seem high at first, but it's extremely reasonable when you figure it's already prepared and ready to eat, and it will be the best turkey you've ever had.",positive

One pump of this cherry syrup in a glass of Sprite Zero over a cup full of pebble ice is a spot-on zero calorie duplicate for Sonic Cherry Limeades.

"An eye opening documentary about the 1993 siege of a religious sect compound near Waco, Texas. Seventy-six people, including sect leader, David Koresh, perished in a flaming inferno that destroyed the compound. There is still heated debate over how the fire started. Homicide or suicide? Can you still trust government ethics?",positive
"Excellent addition to my wife's cooking!She used to work with the instant soup (powder), but switched to this one, and it is great.The only thing you need to keep in mind, is reducing the amount of salt you are using, as it is already salted.Enjoy!",positive

"Bought this soup because I was in need of a healthy chicken noodle soup. Right as I’m heating it I get the smell of strong onion and spices. Sure enough, I just had a couple spoonfuls because I could not bare the taste. To make matters worse, I was burping up the flavor for hours after I had those two spoonfuls.  Do Not recommend if you have a sensitivity to a lot of onion and spices.",negative
"These are the most satisfying  and best tasting real food keto bars I could find. My favorite flavor is chocolate raspberry but they are all good to me. My body responds to these like they are REAL food, not typical prepackaged health food bars. You know how sometimes your body needs a freshly prepared meal over a quick prepackaged bar that satisfies hunger but leaves you feeling in need of more nutrients? Well these keto bars do that for me, making me feel satisfied and well nourished.",positive
"Can't even taste the difference, this is the best coffee, great roast, love that it's organic and swiss water treated AND affordable",positive

Great value for the money.  We ate on this can for almost a week before it was all gone.  Very fresh and very tasty.  thanks!,positive
Received 2 good little scobies. Scobies were 3-4 inches in diameter and are all you need to make a new scoby. Remember that these are NOT meant to be used to brew a whole gallon of kombucha. These are meant for you to recreate a new scoby yourself that is appropriate for the container you'll be using. You should only make ~1/4 gallon of brew for each scoby and allow the scoby to populate and rebuild you a new one. Give it 3 weeks or so to build a healthy new scoby and stronger brew base for your next batch and you're good to go.,positive
"As another user noted, there were some type of sediments in the drink. I had to throw out the entire batch.",negative

"At 100 cal per bar, these bars pack  a nutritional punch into your diet when you eat them.  These contain only a small amount of calories at a low amount of added sugar. Just enough to give your body a boost, in addition to some protein and fat.  A very healthy, natural bar that makes you feel good after eating it. Perfect for inbetween meals, i enjoy having them between breakfast and lunch.",positive
Worked perfectly! No contaminants. Would purchase again.,positive

"lovely flavors, exatly as expected! came on time for slushy season! great price",positive
The taste is amazing and the size is perfect! No more spoiled and wasted jars of pasta sauce!,positive
Horrible second purchase.  First purchase (brown bottle pictured) was amazing pure extract.  Well done!!  Second bottle (clear bottle pictured) was horrible.  All alcohol and some floral aroma that smells and tastes completely wrong.  No coconut flavor at all.  Smelling the two in comparison is striking - so different.  What happened?  Can't use.  Bought a whole big bottle.  Mad.  Looking elsewhere now.,negative
I’m so glad this exists!,positive
"I ordered the flavored packs and the regular/unflavored multi packs.  These capsules don't always work properly in the Nespresso machine - I'd say one third of them didn't work right for me.  The machine runs really slow and stops prematurely - most likely because these aren't manufactured properly, many of the seals look defective.  All of the coffee is weaker than other brands I've tried especially as compared to Nespresso.  Yes, these are much cheaper but the coffee just isn't good.  The flavored coffees were horrible tasting and weak - all of them.  Again, these are cheaper but I won't be reordering them and feel like they don't deliver whats promised.",negative
"The whole experience was fun, even exciting.  Two cakes come in the box so my sister-in-law split the order with me.  I served half of mine at Thanksgiving and have the other half still frozen for Christmas.  It's so delicious my family can't wait!",positive
Awesome....but buy some honey or agave as well!,positive
A great flavor and taste on a steak or hamburger.,positive

We were out of Himalayan salt and we cannot find it at the grocery story here in our small town. This was just the right amount we needed and at a great price. Thanks!,positive
These satisfy my salty craving. I like that they are in single serving packages. It makes them easy to throw in my purse or the diaper bag. They have a buttery flavor that my two year old and I love.,positive

Almost like real chocolate we had back in the day.  Not do much parrifin... more actual melt in your mouth chocolate.,positive
"So good! Inka in general is one of my favorite coffee substitutes because it always tastes like the perfect cup of coffee and the chocolate flavor is divine! So smooth, rich and chocolaty. Inka in any flavor has a fantastic ""crema"" and a rich dark toasty taste without any of the bitterness of coffee. To me it tastes like the coffee I tried so hard to make coffee with my expensive machines and creamers and syrups etc.Inka, however, actually tastes great black. I do use a splenda or two, but it can be drunk plain  and will taste better than espresso from my $2900 Jura machine filled with my $30 Italian beans and I also save myself all the negative effects of coffee. Wish I tried to switch to this earlier!",positive
Don't know where it was stored or handled during shipping but this sparkling water has no sparkle.  Tastes very similar to alka seltzer.  The use before date was February 2021 and I got this delivered in the last month.,negative
I have a deLonghi espresso maker and these beans make a perfect pull!,positive
This was a Valentine’s Day gift that we bought for ourselves. The items were fresh and tasty. But best of all was the variety.,positive

"Fresh, tasty and quality product..",positive
"I bought prior to Thanksgiving and it turned out OK.  But I thought that perhaps it would be better if I had more stuffing.  This stuff shrinks when it gets wet, where most tend to 'plump up' a bit.So made it a few nights ago and it was AWFUL.  The packages I got were mostly crushed and tasted like 75% SALT.  Looking for another alternative now.",negative
"I bought for my teething baby, he loves the tastes. downfall, i also love the taste. Ha so we share.",positive
Very helpful in creating weight gain and a very short time. You can plan to gain at least 10 pounds when eating this bag of chocolates by yourself. Maybe even 20 if you're already particularly thin.,positive

This oatmeal is excellent..  better than other brands..  and their pancake & waffle mix is wonderful too!,positive
"this review is for POLAR skinless & boneless sardines in olive oil. While they are enjoyable as an alternative to bacon or sausage, they are also an alternative to obtaining omega-3s for maintaing a healthy heart. Polar sardines eliminates 1 more capsule or 1 more tablet for the health conscience eater. No cooking, a quick pate and you have an excellent source of protein for breakfast. Add a little hot sauce and crackers for a snack. Try it you may like it.",positive
what a great cup of coffee,positive
My son love this cake I don’t have pictures because he ate this cake so fast he loves it will order again,positive
"We are on a low carb diet and missing pasta, so I purchased these to check them out. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was NO ODOR. I followed the directions to drain them and toss in a hot pan before mixing with any type of sauce or seasoning. I tossed the warm noodles in a simple butter, olive oil and garlic sauce with red pepper flakes, and topped with parmesan. My son and I both agree that these noodles are an excellent substitute and I will be purchasing these again.",positive
I love EVO and wanted to try something different. I have done a lot of reading on different olive oils and learned that oil from this region tends to be a bit more healthier than others. This Oil was great for caprese salad or salads in general. I also like to dip my fresh baked sourdough in this olive oil. It is fresh and darker green in color. The taste is strong and bold. I cant wait to try their other oils. I'm looking for and EVO that is good for cooking with. I prefer this oil to eat with foods that are uncooked. Although My taste differ greatly than others. I enjoy this olive oil.,positive
They were totally stale and even had an expiration date that was 5 months before I received them. So disappointed.,negative
Delish. It's good. Orange is my favorite. It's versatile. You can add different kinds of fruit with orange.,positive
"I do not like how these stick to my teeth like glue. They are thick and difficult to stomach. I don’t know if it is the egg whites that make them so tacky, but that was disgusting to me,",negative

So fresh and green loved it,positive

Arrived without any broken pieces.  Was a hot in the stockings.,positive
"I have been living the no-sugar lifestyle and I am now a dedicated fan of stevia.  I am also a devoted fan of chocolate covered almonds so this seemed like it would be a match made in heaven. I was not disappointed, the chocolate is more coco based and is a richer dark chocolate.  When I first began using stevia I was turned off by its licorice taste. I have now become used to it and do not taste it anymore.  When I shared some of the almonds with friends their reactions were more like those of mine in the past, they were not fans at all.  I think these almonds would be great for those on Keto or on restricted diets to address diabetes etc. They definitely do not have an overly sweet taste but do a great job of satisfying my chocolate almond craving.",positive
These are wonderful.  Nice a plump.  They are not dried out and nasty.  I was paying this price for one at the store and these are way better quality!!,positive
Matcha!!! Small bag for price but still good!:),positive
"Love em!  Taste great!  Makes a great gift!  Will be buying some more soon when fall comes around, they make a great ""cold weather snack"".",positive
"These are amazing and tough to not eat the entire can in one sitting....  the price varies between $18.39 and $25.46 for some reason.....  either way, worth every penney!",positive
Nice variety. Great for gift or for yourself.,positive
I did not like this bread at all no flavor texture was stiff reminded me of stale bread .,negative

"So, our use is not the traditional use. Our son has dysphagia and has to have his formula thickened. The doctors wanted us to use baby rice cereal or oatmeal. We had no options but to use it during his hospital stay from 1-2 months old. After researching the effects of rice cereal on babies (especially before 42 weeks gestational age), seeing how constipated our son was and realizing the amount of calories he was taking in from it we stopped using it. From then until 7 months (6 months corrected) we used Gelmix. Highly recommend Gelmix, but unfortunately it was getting too expensive. We waited until 6 months corrected age to trial this Arrowroot after doing some research. So far it's been great! The amount of arrowroot that is actually in each bottle is almost negligible. It comes out to less than a gram per ounce. This product thickens very well and not very much is needed overall. It's a lot like using cornstarch but better for you! We've used it here and there for sauces and gravies and it is no different than cornstarch in how to prepare it. I think the price is great as well especially for it being organic.",positive
"I purchased the Jane Parker fruit cake for my husband. He said he had such good memories of it from childhood, but said they were no longer available since there are no more A &P grocery stores. I wrote the name down and went on a quest to find it. My first and only option is amazon because they always have everything. I bought a 48 oz light ring because I thought it could be frozen. My husband ate the entire cake in probably a week during Christmas. He said the color and flavor was exactly what he remembered, and the taste took him back to such happy childhood memories. The packaging was secure and wrapped to perfection to preserve freshness. Thanks so much Amazon for always meeting my expectations, and for making me a shero.",positive
great tasteing Alfredo broccoli noodles.,positive
I am familiar with this brand of tea.  When it was offered as a “gift box” I was very interested.  To my surprise this was not a gift box selection.  The correct number was merely put in a plain white box!  Individual servings literally throw. In a box.  Not at all attractive to give as a gif.  I’ll just keep it and use it myself.  Won’t be fooled by this description again.,negative
"Wow, I LOVE ❤️ this BBQ sauce. So sweet and tangy, your family will never guess that it’s low carb. Perfect for my diet now, but I’ll keep using it long term to maintain my weight loss.They are sold in packs of 3, but don’t let that scare you away. This is perfect for a marinade of pork in the crockpot. You will use it up and be glad you have a backup bottle.The packaging is impressive. I don’t see any way that a bottle could ever get broken in shipment. Happy to have just received a new order. 😊Ann",positive
"Love this stuff! I put it on everything, especially sweet potatoes and eggs.",positive

Like the flavor and the container it comes in.,positive
"Curious....what happened to this vanilla?  Seems watered down.  I find myself having to add double amount to get expected flavor.  THE PRICE JUST KEEPS GOING UP😡.  I do a lot of baking when I don’t bake from scratch (my preference ) I use vanilla to enhance box mixes etc.  I’m switching back to previous vanilla,  this is not the same it used to be.  I guess manufacturer thought no one would notice.",negative
my favorite! Keep making the decaf - maybe more decaf flavors.,positive
"This is the 2nd powdered peanut butter I’ve tried and all of these are gross just mixed as peanut butter. These work out ok in smoothies it seems, and I’ve baked a peanut butter cheesecake with it but, this is an unnecessary product that is far too expensive and tastes awful.",negative

I made raspberry muffins using this oat fiber and it was fantastic! Gluten free and low carb but the consistency was quite a bit like traditional bran muffins. I was very impressed!,positive
"I don't mind a bit of a bitter aftertaste if the taste itself is good, but this is a pretty dull coffee with a nasty aftertaste. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but I am not going to be testing that hypothesis.",negative
"These were so yummy! My only complaints are the price and serving size but if you are low carb, there’s the reason. Still satisfies my cereal and sweet craving! Will buy more when I run low.",positive

"I bought these flowers for my mom for mother's day and she said she couldn't believe how great they were packaged and protected.  Several layers of tender loving care for these flowers.  Also, there were so many of them that she put them into two vases to enjoy.  The flowers were beautiful as well.  My mom said that whoever prepared these wanted to make sure the flowers made it and were properly watered as well.  She told me to always buy flowers from here.",positive
These are great and very yummy. You don't feel like you're dieting and you still get to have delicious snacks with these gummies.,positive
And the flavor and texture work extremely well.  The emulsions are great for this use.  I also like to add chocolate to make a raspberry mocha.,positive

"Since T-discs are no longer available with Starbucks, I've been looking for a suitable replacement. I finally found it.In fact, the Tim Hortons T-discs are better than the coffee you get at a Tim Hortons.

I'm not to sure if I was expecting too much or not but this did not have much flavor...as I love Chicken & Bacon but this was just a creamy bowl of mush. I won't buy again.,negative
"Wow, these taste JUST LIKE they're covered in tonkatsu sauce! I love tonkatsu sauce and I'm always on the lookout for tonkatsu flavored things. They're kind of hard to come by in the States so I'm glad I found these online. It's like eating a large cheese puff, only instead of cheese it's a savory, slightly spicy powder all over them. I'd definitely recommend these, I ordered some so I'd have a snack during quarantine and I'm in love.",positive
we love it. this is the closest one to real coconut water. Now Vita Coco became a regular drink at our home instead of other drinks like Coke.. fruit punches etc,positive
"The flavor makes me think about a red snow cone! It's a great beverage! It's refreshing during a workout! I highly recommend, and plan on trying other flavors!",positive
So good.  I ordered again!,positive
In the US our leading brand is MIO and it's absolutely harmful for your body. It contains dyes that are banned elsewhere in the world including the UK as it causes serious health issues but the US keeps it in our food to keep us sick so they can make more money but in the UK healthcare is better as it's universal so they watch out for their citizens because they don't want more illnesses whereas in the US it's so corrupt that they make sure to keep toxic chemicals in foods even adding them in unnecessarily.Anyway rant off but this is the only option I have that's is not only healthy and free of harmful dyes and other toxic chemicals but that tastes delicious and natural. The others in the US all taste artificial and revolting so it's a shame I have to order online and nowhere do I find these anywhere in stores near me. Perhaps in the future but for now I don't mind ordering these here as they are well worth it.,positive
The best coffee I have ever had and unfortunately for me everyone in my office thinks so to. Everyone in my office ask me when I’m making my coffee so they don’t have to drink the companies coffee. For a pound of coffee costing $20 it’s a little pricey,positive

Love this brand. Spreads easy and you don’t have to put into refrigerator,positive

The best carob ever. Everything else is crap,positive
"I bought these for snacks or meal replacements and am happy with them.  They're a decent size and fresh tasting.  I find dark chocolate to be a bit bitter, so if you don't like bitter chocolate these may not be for you.",positive
"My family likes these better than pretzels with gluten! Great for dipping with peanut butter, hummus, chocolate, nutella!",positive
It has no weird aftertaste and helps me manage my diabetes.,positive
Definitely our new favorite flavor of Quest Chips!,positive
I lover this stuff! So delicious! I take it for a snack at work.,positive
"The candy is unusually hard, possibly stale. The candy doesn't have the usual vibrant colors, it's more of a dull, muted color. The pictures indicated the package contained the green apple flavor, but it's the one with lime instead. The only reason I ordered it was because it was supposed to be green apple. VERY disappointed to find them stale and no green apple.",negative

Simply the best hot sauce out there!,positive
"These are bigger, softer, sweeter and less bitter than the WinCo bulk variety, which are $10 lb. (and contain sulfur dioxide as a preservative). Bear in mind, without preservatives like Sulphates and Sulphites, a moist product will get moldy in the absence of meticulous sanitation practices, which is why preservative-free foods are often irradiated, to sterilize them in right in the package. Viva claims not to irradiate. In IMHO, an occasional moldy bag could be considered a good thing, indicating only the occasional spore or two are slipping into an otherwise clean production system. Providing the seller has a good reputation for promptly remedying the situation, and it's only fair to give them the chance to do right by their customers before leaving a negative review, I don't see what the big deal is.They taste better when soaked. If I expect them to stay in the fridge for more than a week I use 30-40% vodka (and/or maybe a little honey) and filtered water to re-hydrate them to prevent potential mold growth. The easiest way to add these in measured amounts to smoothies, since I don't consider soaking an option, is to grind them finely and dry them in front of a heat register at >%30 humidity. Even when adding a couple tablespoons cornstarch, the powder blends beautifully, but you have to empty the blender immediately or it'll form a solid clump in the blender, freezing the blades, necessitating a strong chef's knife to dislodge the rest. The sugar is so sticky it'd take %0 humidity to make a pour-able product. (It's like grinding frozen honey and raisins). I've found that dumping the powder right into a mini ice cube tray which makes 1/2"" cubes, spreading it out and tamping it down a bit makes nice pre-measured amounts, but they still stick to each other like crazy.My guess is a freeze-drying process is the only way to make something which doesn't stick too badly (until it's opened, it's a very hydrophilic material). Still, tearing off a cube is the easiest thing to do every day.",positive
My wife love this decaf. This is about our 5th box.  Very good price.,positive
Easy on your stomach and tastes great. I have been using this coffee for a long time. I prefer the whole beans so I can grind them fresh.,positive
I use this on everything and find myself buying bottle after bottle constantly so finding this size was a huge money saver,positive
"This is what to use if you do not want to use sugar in your tea or coffee. No side effects, no after taste. Also you do not waste little bags of paper.",positive
Fresh. Good,positive
Extremely satisfied with this ghee. I ordered this one after going through a lot of other brands. Ghee is used in traditional Indian cooking since a long time. We are using it everyday for our Indian cooking. We are 100% satisfied with our purchase.,positive
"These are the real thing. Moist, beautiful & truly delicious. This is a set of three trays, once you open a tray there is not lid, simply wrap with saran wrap and they stay perfectly fresh. This is a true NY memory.Real Marzipan & amazing value.",positive
"I'm from Alaska. I grew up on wild caught salmon we brought in ourselves. Is this THAT good? Of course not but I've tried several brands of cans and pouches and this is, by FAR, the best. The container size is perfect for snack or to add to a salad or some pasta with butter and garlic for a quick easy meal. The fact the ingredients list is only THREE items is fantastic! Salmon, water, and salt. That's it. I ordered one box to try it and it was gone in about a week. This last time I ordered three boxes.",positive
"I love the taste of the tea!!  I love that the tea is Biodynamic!!  However, it is more like black tea than green tea.  In the past my Darjeeling has been more of a green color than brown.  But I like it so much that I will order it again when I run out.",positive
An excellent morning ZAP!,positive
"My wife loves the coffee!  She always felt like espresso was a guilty pleasure, but these are such a good value that she enjoys them much more often.",positive
These are very good and a good value. I ordered original last 2 times and ordered turkey this time. Very good.,positive
"I've had these candles years ago and loved them. This order i received from Amazon were clearly old candies, even though they were within expiry on the package. These candles are supposed to be hard butterscotch, but the outer half of the candy is stale and chewy. Once you get thru that, the inner half of the candy is the delicious butterscotch I love.",negative
"Threw it away. Dry, full of thick strands and pods. Nasty.",negative
"These were very tasty, hard not to eat the whole bag in one sitting, I would buy again and may, but kind of expensive.",positive
Tastes great. Love using this to combat bloating or ease the pain of overeating.,positive
Smells horrible---not a fan!,negative
"This is the best peanut brittle I've tried. I was never a big peanut brittle fan, but this stuff is really good. It is in bite size pieces and doesn't break your teeth. In addition, it is made from easily pronounceable ingredients, and no high fructose syrup in it.",positive
"It smells like butter, and tastes like cardboard. When the bag is done popping, it’s half full and there’s a handful of kernels unpopped. I don’t mean 5 or 6 I mean like 30 or more. All these great reviews have me thinking none of these other people have ever eaten popcorn before.",negative
Lot's of herbs and color but not much flavor.Salt and pepper is better.,negative
These sandwich crackers are my daily snack..I saved so much by buying in bulk..always fresh and tasty.,positive
Great strongly flavored decaf brew.  Very good iced or Hot.,positive
"This taffy has soft texture at room temperature, but doesn't stick to your teeth. Rich flavors are great, but next time I'll confine my order to traditional flavors and pass on some of the ""exotics"". Their sugar free taffy is one of the few products that actually tastes as good, or better than, the original. Order to delivery time is reliable, but not extremely fast... and they're not cheap, but you get what pay for.  The 2lb family pack (and larger) brings the unit cost down to something more reasonable. Although we don't eat this stuff frequently, we are  very satisfied return customers.",positive
Very fast shipping and excellent product.,positive
"These came in smashed on 1 corner of all 3 cartons. 3 of 3 were also leaking slightly. They don't take returns or replacements, so I just lost money as they need to be thrown away. Extremely annoyed.",negative
Paprika had  alive bugs inside.,negative
Delicious as always and arrived fresh and intact. We will order again!,positive
"I ordered and received this in March when the weather was cool.  I ordered other candy bars as well.  This pack of Hershey Cookies and Cream was all mushed up and I can't give it out because it's crumbling in the package.  Wish I had opened it when it came in, but I didn't need it right away and now it's just trash.",negative
I really wanted to like these. They’re horrible. They taste too sweet and chemically.  They smell like rubbing alcohol. Did not satisfy my poptart craving at all. These are very expensive and you are not able to return them.,negative
"Don’t expect the chunks of breast meat that you find in most canned chicken. This is more of a pressed/formed paste or a pate.  If you can get over it looking dog food-ish, it actually tastes alright.",negative
"I ordered these and they came in a perfect shape, none was bent or either destroyed...",positive
"Delicious, this is some really good menudo for menudo eater’s... I recommend this to everyone that likes menudo.. Not like home cooked,but just as good if you want something quick... Enjoy!!",positive
The variety of these pods are great. All the flavors thus far are really tasty . I sent a box to my granddaughter away at school. She said it was so good that I bought myself a box.,positive
Best dark blue I have ever used!,positive
Great flavors and strong too. I use this to make my own kombucha tea. Adding green tea for other benefits.,positive
We LOVE A-1 sauce.  BUT...who in their right mind would pay over $8.00 for a 5oz bottle?  This is the most deceptive advertising I have ever seen on an Amazon listing.  BUYER BEWARE....this is NOT a case of A-1 as it 'appears'.  THIS IS WRONG.,negative
"We love Caramel Apple Pops,  Stores only have them in the Fall, Halloween To Thanksgiving!  Glad We can order anytime on Our favorite Amazon,",positive
This are excellent.  They have plenty of pumpkin in them.  It's like having warm pumpkin pie.,positive
"I check in to see which Hint product happens to be cheaper week-to-week, and although I'm never sure why one is more than another, one week Pear was in the ""under $13"" range and I finally tried it (because I couldn't justify it when it was over $17 for the 12-pk). It was GREAT. Crisp, refreshing and very ""pear"", without any chemical taste like I experienced with Hint's Peach and Apple. In a three-way-tie with Hint Cherry and Watermelon, it's my favorite! Try it!",positive
"Perfect for a light snack. I bought these as part of a small gift basket I put together for my t-ball team members. Perfect size.I was hesitant to by food from here (afraid I would get something passed its expiration), but was not disappointed - Very fresh!",positive
"I switched from artificial sweeteners to the honey granules. A more healthy, and delicious alternative. The quality of the products from Hoosier Hill Farm never disappoints.",positive
"I’ve used this for years, but nowhere around here to get it. So glad it’s still available this way!  Great for grilling, great on beef, pork, chicken ... I’ve even put it on grilled veggies!  Spicy without being painfully hot. :)",positive
"This is my absolute favorite meat seasoning! I literally put it on everything. I’ve never really been a steak fan, but steak with this seasoning on it… makes my mouth water.",positive
"Did not opened yet, but arrived in time and looks so delicious. Can't wait to taste it!",positive
Ended up throwing these out. They were super dry and flavorless!,negative
this product did come up to my standards for good taste and my coffee maker has a grinder and the beans would stick and not grind completely.,negative
"Delivery got delayed due to it being sent to the wrong facility then when it got here, I could see that the chocolate had melted and then reformed which messed with the consistency and taste.",negative
"Cashews received were not organic as purchased, and they arrived stale and had to be thrown away.",negative
Used for lavender tea latte and it is fantastic!,positive
Tastes great…enjoy as a snack.,positive
2 of 4 cans were dented.,negative
I  normally purchase Rays country ham but this seemed like a good buy the trimmings. I cooked a few pieces the day I received it and OMG that night I had the worst intestinal pain which was so bad I had to call in sick from work the next day. May not be the manufactures fault could have been sitting in a hot warehouse some where I don't know. But I had to throw it all away:(  Please remember you get what you pay for.,negative
This fruit is healthy. And with a delicious taste. The cans arrived in good condition. And I made my delicious Lychee tea.😋😋Esta fruta es saludable . Y con un sabor delicioso. Las latas llegaron en buenas condiciones. Y me prepare mi te de Lychee delicioso.😋😋,positive
The perfect sauce to make the perfect dish.,positive
Awesome products! Super fast shipping! AAA+,positive
My favorite are the kettle corn flavor and this was a good deal,positive
This is my favorite flavor of this brand. Beware of the marketing though. I don’t know why but I thought I was getting a 12-pack hahaha,positive
Secret Santa gift and they were exactly what my co worker loved as a child. Perfect!,positive
"I really like this product. I use it for my baking goods and it taste great. I bought 3 bags, the expiration date was 11/2022, I bake a lot so this is no big deal for me but for those that use it sparingly then it'd be an issue",positive
Much smaller box then regular pasta,negative
Don't overcook.  Good pasta.,positive
My daughter like the decorations & the price was good for everything,positive
"Easy to make and fast, tasted good",positive
Just received these peppercorns and to my surprise saw a large sticker labeled” heavy”. This didn’t add up since the peppercorns are very light in weight. I opened the pack to check the other side of the packaging to see a huge rip in the pack that conveniently had a sticker perfectly placed over to con seal the tear… really gross to think about animals/bugs that could have gotten into into this while in a warehouse.,negative
"This is noodle is full of flavor. Hot (spicy) but not enough to over power the great taste. Very enjoyable and very versatile. Add cooked chicken, beef, pork or salmon and veggies for a meal. It is so tasty on its own that you don’t need any extras. I buy 2 cases at a time and make sure I never run out.",positive
Don’t purchase you can’t return and it’s so gross.,negative
"LOVE THIS GUM!  IT IS MY FAVORITE GUM, I CAN NOT FIND THIS GUM IN STORES ANYMORE.  SO I WILL DEFINITELY BUY MY GUM FROM AMAZON.",positive
United Airlines served these delicious cookies during our flight. Never heard of Stroopwafls before. Never tasted anything like it before either. But OMG!!! They’re so addicting. I had to order these when I came home from my trip.,positive
"Punch Drunk is a great tasting Hot Sauce and I always put it on my egg omelets and burgers, or anything needing extra kick.",positive
"Oatmeal was not my first choice for breakfast, but when I tried the oatmeal bites, I couldn't stop eating it! I love all the flavors, and I like the fact that I can eat it on the go.",positive
"This icing had a bitter taste and an almost marshmallow-like texture that was weirdly warm. It smells nice, but the taste isn’t even close to the smell. Thankfully I tasted it before putting it on my cake.",negative
Great tea ... it works!  PLEASE bring back the chocolate flavor!!!!!!,positive
One of the best teas!  It makes for a perfect dessert tea.  I actually made ice tea out of it and it was simply delightful.  It is not a heavy taste when iced.,positive
This coffee was a disappointment.  It had no flavor.  Will not order again,negative
My husband didn't even let them cool down before he had 4 of them chowed down he says they tasted better then he thought they would and it's awesome they are healthy for you.,positive
This is the best tasting nutritional yeast I have had. There is no bitterness like some of the others. The flavor is closer to mushrooms with a nutty overtone.  Delicious!,positive
"WoW, a clear drinking H20 , flush out the body system. Great to drink",positive
The Gatorade has been a good thing for the both of us.,positive
The new and NOT improved flavor is so disappointing. Now it tastes like they poured all the aspartame they could in it and has a terrible aftertaste! Used to buy this on regular delivery. I now have about 12 boxes that are going into the sewer system where even the alligators will turn their noses! Go back to the original!!!!!,negative
So quick and Barilla's sauce is delicious!!,positive
"Great for soups, breakfast and sandwiches.",positive
I love this coffee . I make ice coffee with this and I drink it black with ice it’s so delicious! I can’t drink any other coffeeTotal obsession I am addicted :),positive
Same peanut butter you buy in the store.  So until the local stores lower their prices (not holding my breath on that) I'll keep buying here.,positive
"It wasn't listed in the product description, but there are numerous allergens (wheat, milk, soy, and tree nuts) it could contain. I wasnt able to use the product because of that.",negative
Nothing to dislike . I use this as often as possible.,positive
The package was partially smashed and suet was leaking out of the box.,negative
I ordered fine couscous and I I got medium couscous,negative
Good old fashioned ginger ale .  great price.,positive
"if you like rice and want gluten free, this is the ticket.",positive
Honey butter kirimochi ❤️👍,positive
Great flavor and great shelf life.,positive
I ordered these as a gift for my step son and had them delivered to him. The report from him is these are large and delicious chestnuts. Delivery was very prompt also. Thanks for being a great seller and having a high quality product. A++++,positive
Tate’s makes great cookies my only regret is that they have so few to a packageOnce you eat one you can’t stop 😊😊😊,positive
"Good if these are often snack, good to control portion.",positive
I think this is the best hot chocolate I've ever had - at least in a mix form like this.Only warning is it doesn't taste as good with water (like some other mixes seem to)... It's got to be milk or it just isn't as good!,positive
had to buy again!,positive
The candy which is obviously mostly chocolate was just shipped in a normal box without anything to protect it from the heat. Every piece was a melted mess,negative
"Great flavor for icies, protein shakes, milkshakes and lasts for longer then you might think. Highly concentrated.",positive
"My favorite decaf tea. Not too weak and not too strong flavor. Perfect for a late night cuppa. The only downside is the price but you get what you pay for, it’s really good.",positive
Completely full of aspartame. If you have any sensitivities avoid. Worst migraine ever.,negative
"Shipping was fast, topper is beautiful.  Very lightweight so be careful storing and transporting it.",positive
"Wow, these were hugely disgusting. I don't think I've ever had a more disgusting snack. It tasted like someone threw up in my mouth. My husband had to spit his out. I seriously wanted to throw up after eating one of these.",negative
This tea is delicious! Taste great hot or iced! I’m not a tea drinker and tasted it in a medicine ball at Starbucks and loved it! I don’t use the spearmint flavor any longer but this peach tranquility is soooo delicious and great to drink in the evening!,positive
I love this so much 10/10 rate,positive
great value for the money a favorite,positive
"Have not planted it, yet (so don't know how it will grow, etc.).  It arrived on time, clean & well documented.",positive
"[[VIDEOID:c5eacc0ee940a00d2c8f5a4f6e6f4c46]] Warning: These cookies are seriously good and could be addicting!!After the first box, I've purchased these same cookies about 6 times now. Not only are they good to the taste buds, but after eating just 1 bag I literally feel my milk let down. These cookies increased my milk supply for sure. Not by a crazy Amount, but by enough to make a difference. I definitely recommend!",positive
Delicious flavor and the company sent the chocolate with an ice pack so it would not melt in the heat.Will definitely purchase again.,positive
It had an off flavor. Will go back to McCormick and Morton and Brown,negative
Bag came with a hole in it and now there’s quinoa everywhere.,negative
"I do a lot of baking, and my husband loves his salt, so we use quite a bit of salt for just 2 adults.The logical thing is to buy this type of staple in bulk. The downside of doing that is it can get clumpy, or old. To avoid that, I bought this 'case' of the standard round containers of Morton Salt. The perfect solution. Buying a large quantity of a high quality, name brand table salt, while still getting a fresh product all the time at a great price.I really like this size much better than the 4 pound boxes, or 10# sized cans. If I had more room, I'd buy several cases at a time. With Amazon Prime free shipping, it makes a good deal, even better (though I think my mailman hates me:)",positive
"These were super cute! We’re using them as part of my son’s birthday party favor bags. Would have been nice to receive more variety of characters, but happy to have more Pikachu since it’s one of the more popular character.",positive
These are my favorite pickles ever but they came open and all the brine is missing so very disappointed!!,negative
Only powder I use,positive
Absolutely delicious and fresh candy!,positive
tasted terrible.. I like the smaller ones these were way to big for that taste,negative
"I drink my ""soda water"" every morning, so very glad to have this product.",positive
"The product I received was resealed to appear ""new/unopened"". The case has dings and scratches and the DVD is scratched as well. Very disappointed.",negative
Sooo love this tea,positive
"Horrible, nothing like the original",negative
"We love sweet potato fries and we have bought this before. This time around, we opened a package last night and there were black and green spots. We thought initially that it was just natural colors or freezer burn. However the closer we looked, it was mold. Someone left this out for a very long time without refrigeration then refrigerated it again. Absolutely gross. We have decided not to buy this again.",negative
This is a delish product with a kick. Price is not too bad considering no shells and no cleaning. It is also low calorie. Excellent!!! Will order this again !,positive
"I fell in love with these at my campus during my 2nd year of undergrad. 4 years and a complete lifestyle change later, these are one of the things that I forgot how good they were. Had my first one before a big test, and for the first time in a long time I was a grade point above average! This stuff knows how to taste great and keep you awake. Exactly what I paid for!",positive
There seems to be a distinct oily flavor in all of them ( not coconutty) that my son did not like at all. We were expecting a similar taste to the adult versions but unfortunately they had a different taste all together.,negative
"Loved this variety pack, getting to sample all flavors was nice. Tastes great and I will be buying more again soon!",positive
A great find through Amazon Fresh! The flavors are wonderful and made my curry dishes so delicious and sorry - no leftovers EVER!Masarap (delicious in Tagalog)!!!Joe,positive
These tasted like someone ground up cardboard and made it somehow a crunchy chip. I’m glad I only paid $2.00 for the sample. I’ll never buy these again.,negative
"Candy packaging was ok, however the candy was HORRIBLE!  Never again will I buy candy from Amazon.  And, you can’t return it!?  We couldn’t even eat one piece before spitting it out, disgusting!  Extremely disappointed!",negative
"Fast Service,  Amazing Tea!  Will definitely order again",positive
"Love this product! I substituted the butter for coconut butter--definitely not a mistake. So delicious. Adding Pamela's Dark Chocolate Frosting Mix (also using coconut butter instead of butter) makes this entire cake so delectable. It is definitely pricey online, but if your neighborhood grocery store will order it for you it goes for $4.50-$6.00. Its worth the cost though.",positive
Goes quick but so good,positive
Ordinary tasting and way too expensive.  Save your money and buy something else from your local grocer.  I recommend mixing real maple syrup with your favorite corn syrup based product.,negative
"Well, I love miso soup, so these are a necessity.  Unfortunately, I've discovered that my cat loves them, too, and Kitty got into the pantry the other night and climbed up four (4!) shelves to reach the bag, drop it to the ground and scatter the flakes all over the floor.  I only got one use out of the flakes, and now my pantry smells like New Jersey.  I'll probably order more soon.  Oh, P.S., these are indistinguishable from the bonito flakes I used when I lived in Tokyo, so you can be sure they are perfectly authentic.  Don't let your cat know you have them.",positive
Wow.  Ordered three bottles.  One was broken upon arrival.  Went to the returns page to request  replacement for the one bottle - and discovered this item is ineligible for returns.  WTF?  What do I do about my broken bottle?,negative
Awful. Taste like glue. I wasn't happy at all. I have purchased several of their other products. This one was the worst.,negative
"These tasted stale and were pretty hard compared to other purchases I’ve made. Also, the bag and manufacturer are different than pictures. The bag is an upgrade actually but not the quality. Not returnable.",negative
Buyer beware! Nowhere in the ingredients does it list gluten or gluten as allergy warning. I had a severe gluten reaction!,negative
Love!!!!  I was born and raised in Tokyo so it’s great to enjoy all the snacks,positive
This is an allowable snack on my diet so i'm thrilled to be able to buy them here,positive
Grandchildren were given these in their Christmas stockings.  Not thrilled with the joke but liked the crispy chocolate.,positive
These work to instantly curb my chcolate cravings!  I actually hide them from my peeps so I have them just for me!,positive
"Leaking cans, smashed box",positive
Every flavor taste great and hard part is not drinking 5 a day.,positive
Great KRAFT Cheese Slices!,positive
Absolutely LOVE Essentia water so to have the option to have it delivered AND on autopay completely exceeded my expectations. I am highly satisfied. I recommend any and everyone to take this offer!,positive
"It’s super fine, it’s sugar and it’s easy to store and pour from - live sugar in a milk carton, no granules spilling off a bag onto floor and counter.",positive
This tea is DELICIOUS!! It literally tastes like you are drinking a warm cookie! I have been on a sugar fast and this has literally saved me. I will definitely be ordering more of this when the time comes!,positive
"I bought a case of these during quarantine when food was scarce in the grocery store, a canned pasta sauce is not something I would normally buy.. Anyway, I used a can to make spaghetti and the flavor was terrible. I don’t think I’ve ever tasted a tomato based sauce that was that bad. We ended up donating these to a good bank.I’m used to fresh and sometimes bottled tomato sauces, so maybe I’m just the wrong customer for this type of sauce, but honestly it tasted like crap.",negative
For some unknown reason our local Weis and Giant grocery stores here in central Pennsylvania have stopped offering Kraft Sandwich Spread on their shelves.  So ... to Amazon we went and low and behold it was available through them.  It costs more than we liked but at least we could get it.  Hellman's is readily available here but we have acquired a preferred taste for the Kraft brand.  This sandwich spread makes the best deviled egg filling.  Just the BEST!Our order came well packed and had three plastic containers. Yum!,positive
"Amazon inventory on this product is incorrectly labeled at this time (Aug. 8, 2018). My first order as well as the replacement were both labeled correctly as Vadouvan Curry on the outside packaging; however, the item inside is correctly labeled as Za'atar.",negative
My husband loves it!  Good stuff!,positive
Keeps tortillas warm For a long time. Beautiful and arrived quickly!,positive
Great cassava flour and good value,positive
Good quality and exactly as described... I received this much faster than expected also! Thank you!,positive
"This machine looks great and operates perfectly! I was worried about the bulb arriving damaged, as several reviews have stated. However ours was in tact and my office is obsessed with it! Yes, our OFFICE! We LOVE popcorn! We also purchased the same brand ready made popcorn packs and it makes AMAZING POPCORN. I am so proud of our beautiful popcorn maker!",positive
The taste was not what I expected.  Not chocolatey at all.  Is it supposed to be tasteless?,negative
Do NOT buy Ancient Harvest Green Lentil Spaghetti!!!! It is AWFUL!  It tastes like wet cardboard.  I tried it twice to make sure I didn’t mess up the cooking instructions.  It was horrible both times.  Unfortunately I am forced to throw out the remaining 4 boxes from the carton of six because I have passed the return period.  It is so bad that I wouldn’t donate it to a homeless shelter.  I have tried Banza brand & others that are plant based & gluten free.  This is the only brand that has been inedible.,negative
"This is the best salt I have ever had.  Fluer de Sel is fantastic for salting meats on the grill, sprinkling on top of buttered bread.  It is soft and moist and wonderful.",positive
"Excellent flavor.  I like iced coffee and this is better than using leftover coffee maker coffee kept in the fridge.  Just wish it was a bit more affordable.  14 cups only from one bottle.  Yes, its  cheaper than a coffee shop, but I don't do that.",positive
Love this hot sauce on wings.,positive
I normally make my own extract so I am very picky. This has other stuff in it which makes it slimy. Funny smell-taste is okay but not good quality. Needs improvement. I suggest smaller packing with less fillers. It would still be a bargain because vanilla is expensive.,negative
I have used for years. Amazon is the least expensive place to purchase. Very healthy and low in calories.  I use in shakesa as well as making peanut butter sandwichs.,positive
"I've always liked this cereal, and it is suppose to be health-promoting.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, to find in my local grocery stores, so I'm pleased it can be purchased through Amazon.",positive
Excellent quality chocolate! Was a big hit with the kids and will order again!,positive
I love it. Will definitely buy it again! Taste like movie theater popcorn.,positive
Very delicious highly recommended. A great tea to drink when you want to relax,positive
"Amazing taste, great quality, and nice packaging for the quantity and price.",positive
These capsules are absolutely our favorite right now! We can have 4 cups on a day! The flavors are delicious and fresh!!  It’s a great bang for your buck!,positive
The best Coffee ever made. Vet owned operated. Nothing says more American than BRCC. Highly recommend,positive
Tastes like strands of boiled paper towels.  No thanks.,negative
Whole box expired in pissed.. Today's date 9/28/2022.. All packs expired in July of 2022.. Somebody better make it right...,negative
I make my own pure chocolate and stevia bars with silicone bar molds purchased at Amazon.  So farso great.  Easy to do.  Freeze in 15 mins and ta-da your own bars for 1/3 the price!!,positive
Disappointed in the flavors. There are better options out there. Won’t buy again.,negative
"open the lid and you will be looking for your matching eggs and toast. it smells simply divine!I add this to coffee, especially flavors like chocolate and hazelnut.not too much, because the flavor is strong. better to go light and then add more.",positive
"This is my all time favorite ice tea. Has such a great flavor. I don't use any sweeteners in my tea, so the flavor comes through. Highly recommend.",positive
I enjoy Gevalia and the  price was amazing.,positive
This stuff is pretty much the bomb.  I'm too lazy to make it at home and I like the way this tastes compared to the Starbucks store version- not as 'acidy' if that makes sense.  It's super delicious over ice!,positive
"I like the crackers very much.  But this is way over priced.  My parents bought them from Asian food markets, and costed around $7.",negative
"I bought these for a recent backpacking trip just for the sake of it. Glad I did because they were surprisely good and there was a good portion of green beans. Splitting a MHM plus one of the sides, such as a the beans, was plenty of food for a backpacking dinner.",positive
Great tasting coffee and quick delivery as always!,positive
"Delicious in its own right, not just as a sub for something chocolate chip. Great buttery taste.  Arrived intact with at least three months till expiration",positive
I have yet to find a shell in these black walnuts.  I would definitely buy them again when my supply is exhausted.,positive
Would buy again. Great texture. Heat from the ginger is perfect amount.,positive
"We already love the banana flavor, so wanted to try the other flavors too. Chocolate is now my favorite. The only thing that I would like to see, is this made into sucker form because it is so sticky to hold once the paper is pulled all the way off...made like the discontinued BB BATS suckers.",positive
"so yum! GF, DF chocolaty minty goodness",positive
It was nice to add flavor to the water I’m drinking. As good as the water by itself can be it’s nice to have a little flavor in it to make drinking my daily amount more interesting.,positive
Great with baked sweet potatoes!!!,positive
"These are not as healthy as the natural almonds, but they are crunchier.",positive
best buy!,positive
"fast delivery, item as described, good seller, A+",positive
I was charged for six packages but only received one,negative
I find the flavor of these candies to be true. You put one in your mouth and instantly the flavor is there . I have ordered these candies there times they are so good.,positive
"Needs a heavier duty bag, it’d be nice if it came in a recloseable (zip) bag. Package was shipped w/ flax seed. Bag came apart @ seal, turmeric all over 😳",negative
All the balloons and decorations came in so quickly in such cute packaging. I am so excited to celebrate my 21st Birthday and I am so happy Sonia has helped me accomplish my dream party.,positive
"I have like 4 different hazelnuts in there, but he just uses them and doesn't tell me which one he likes, but he said, this ones good! I said which one, he says, I don't know, I just grab. So I looked in and it was the folgers hazelnut cream, so I started getting more.I really wish mom, dad, and he would tell me which flavor to get cause I have so many now!But mom n dad liked it too, and they're picky!",positive
I love the powder. smells really good and it is perfect measurement for small deserts.  Love it.  definitely getting more,positive
The colors are dull- I bought these to mix into chocolate melts. It did not mix well at all. Ruined my chocolate. 😭I do not recommend.,negative
Excellent ingredient for holiday snack mix,positive
"Gave this as a get well, cheer up gift.  Received rave reviews, it was really enjoyable,  and they couldn't get over the variety.  I will be sure to send this gift again should the opportunity arise.",positive
Love the the flavor! I drank mine with almond milk but I want to try it with coffee❤️❤️❤️,positive
These are so yummy!! They are the perfect mix of milk and dark chocolate as well as a sweet little cracker like stem.,positive
Worked great for granddaughter's birthday cakepops!,positive
Box came opened and damaged. They are not the size they show in the pictures. They are half the size shaped like a square. I should have read the reviews before buying. 🙁,negative
"I like this company for freshness, good flavor.It brings back memories of my grandma making cookies with these gumdrops in them.

Creamy and good!,positive
"This stuff is amazing and should be a staple in every baker's kitchen.  You can't beat the price, either.",positive
Exactly what I needed at a great price. Super fast delivery. No warehouse stores near me so this was great,positive
"i got these pods after getting a new Nespresso vertuo and I have to say, this espresso makes some of the best lattes I've ever made. it's not too strong and gives just the right amount for a latte. my mom and sister love this and request lattes every time they come over. definitely recommend it if you're looking for what's the best espresso to start off with.",positive
"The flavor is very weak unless adding 3x more than the recommended serving. It also has an odd taste, like paper. This is a good choice for someone who likes very weak iced coffee.",negative
My church serves coffee to about 75 people every Sunday. We like the min-moo because it’s real 1/2 & 1/2.,positive
"I've loved this product in the past, but what arrived at our house yesterday is disgusting. Separated and unusable, no matter how much I shake it. I read the reviews, but I was under the impression that others were having similar issues because they lived in a freezing climate. I live in California, and the weather has been in the 60s, so I thought it would be fine, but I was wrong. It can't be returned, so a total waste of $10 and I'm not happy.",negative
"Junk, don’t waste your money. Non returnable",negative
they produced so much better than advertised,positive
This Matcha Honey was delicious!!!!  It had lots of Matcha in comparison to other brands.  It is great in tea and on bread or toast.  I even added it to recipes and it enhanced nicely.,positive

I love the filtered bottom.  More hopefully biodegradable than the standard cups.  Taste is really good.  Will be buying more when time comes.,positive
These were awesome...a little sweeter than I expected but they were still yummy.,positive
Absolutely love this tea! It has such a great berry flavor!,positive
This can’t be good.,negative
Save money and buy sunflower seeds at your local grocery store for a better quality than these for sure,negative
No damage in transit. Good product.,positive
"Nice flavor. I added this sauce to everything and was especially a great hit in my chicken, parmesean wraps.  I would purchase this set again. The price was right and quantity fulfilled its purpose",positive
Great bar mix. A real crowd pleaser when you are entertaining and need a little something to munch on. Product was as described and delivered on time.,positive
"These are an excellent gingersnap for people who truly appreciate ginger.  The cookies have a nice snap to them and there are bits of real ginger throughout.  Very similar to Trader Joe's gingersnaps in both taste, size and appearance, but a tiny bit different in color.  Highly recommend.",positive
I did not like the flavor of this candy.,negative
We made this with a cream cheese frosting that we added vanilla and orange zest to. The result was excellent.,positive
This Matcha green tea is the best I have tasted and I also love how it is packaged.,positive
Don’t waste your money the darn thing died even though I took good care of it😡😡😡,negative
"Great, of course, as a sub for eggs to use as a binder. I just ground up some in my VitaMix this morning for that very purpose. This is 2 bags of flax seed for a very good price. Also, I like everything I've ever tried from NOW Foods. Have used their protein powders, organic coconut oil--which is the best I ever tasted or smelled--& many other NOW Foods products & have never been disappointed in anything.",positive
Candy expired 8 months before arrival at our residence,negative
these are so yummy.,positive
"I highly recommend this generous assortment of candies be tried before ordering the individual candies that are offered.  You get some of each kind of sucker, hard candy and caramel that Dr.John and his wife make. All of them were fresh and delicious. I've been a sugar addict for a long time and these hit the spot!  The only one that I didn't care for was the mint sucker.  I'm not a fan of mint as that is the only other xylitol candies that I have found anywhere.  I've been sugar free for 1 1/2 years now and I've been using xylitol exclusively as my suger substitute. .The xylitol doesn't make me have a lot of gas like other sugar free sweeteners do, especially Malitol.  And it's good for your teeth and researchers are discovering all kinds of benefits for using xylitol.  This is a great choice for dieters, diabetics, and anyone who loves candy.",positive
"Just to let you all know to remove the salty taste just soak the cured bacon in cold water for 4 to 8 hours changing water every 2 hours. If you smoke it have no fear water soaking will not remove the smoke flavored any other flavor. Then remove from water and let it sit in frig over night to dry. I have done 100's of lbs of bacon, Canadian bacon and others. Have fun!",positive
"Beggars can't be choosers. Diabetics don't have many choices so companies charge what I refer to as a diabetes tax (I.e., jacking the price up, because diabetics have no other choice).The product itself is exceptional. I use them when I am nauseous from my medication. Try it! Anyway, you can't tell any difference in taste between these and their sugared cousins.",positive
These carrots had slime on them. Disgusting,negative
I've used Morton and Bassett spices for years and have always been happy with their quality especially with their nutmeg.,positive
"I’m a huge oatmeal lover. As a BJJ practitioner, I primarily use its complex carb for energy and benefits, such as fiber and etc. that being said, I tried to use something similar to it’s hot, complex content. So I tried Hot Cereal but man, the taste was super blend. It is filling and soaks up a lot of water to be microwaved “properly.” I wouldn’t eat this without seasoning, and other foods.",positive
"I usually buy the regular 7.5 oz box with 3 servings and I'd cook the whole box and overeat and/or waste a lot of it by throwing the rest I couldn't finish into the compost bin after it grew moldy in my refrigerator.  This size is better since it's broken down into 1 serving per pouch at still a good price.  And it doesn't waste resources with the cups format.  For someone like me who doesn't cook a lot and whose cooking usually is restricted to easy fast cooking like microwaving frozen burritos, it's a Godsend!!I bought a microwaveable cup on Amazon, put the macaroni inside without even having to measure the water by just making sure the water was only slightly above the macaroni level.  It only took a few minutes in the microwave. To make it taste better than average, I mixed in grassfed butter & some sliced sharp cheddar cheese with the cheese powder while it was hot.  When the butter & cheese were all melted, I mixed in sour cream and topped it all with sliced green onions & SMOKED paprika.  YUMMY!",positive
This is a perfect replica of the famous Samoa Girl Scout cookies.  And you can't beat the price.  It's hard not to eat the whole box in one sitting!,positive
Most came cracked. Many came shattered. Very disappointing.,negative
This Israeli tea is fantastic.  I recommend it to everyone who likes Green tea with Nana (middle-eastern mint),positive
These are really cute! I used them as decorations for a diaper cake I made for a friend. They are basically thick paper cut outs of onesies glued to heavy duty tooth picks. They look great. Definitely recommend.,positive
You have to acquire a taste for it. I didn’t care for it.,negative
Great taste just like more expensive brands,positive
Great tea!  Be sure to open packets carefully so that sachets don’t tear.,positive
I was really surprised by the smooth creamy taste.  Nothing bitter or after taste.  It reminds me of a cappuccino but a tea.,positive
"I love this olive oil, I put it on everything.",positive
Didn’t get to use the product it was damaged when received. I live in a hot town and the contents inside melted forcing the pressure to leak. If you live in Areas that are very hot temperatures I don’t recommend buying this product especially during summer months,negative
"Instant polenta is never quite as tasty as slowly cooked one, but even among instant polentas (sp?) there are differences.  This is the worst among all the polentas I tried, and I tried many.  A tasteless pap.",negative
A great gift,positive
"I had to cut back on coffee due to blood sugar fluctuations,mid-day crashes, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. I was skeptical to try this, and it sat in my cupboard for months before I was willing to give up my afternoon cup of coffee, but this really hit the spot! I also have severe gluten intolerance. The barley and rye do not upset my stomach at all. Highly recommend! Also dandelion is great for digestion, liver and kidney support,  and reduced inflammation.",positive
Love this product.  Used to get it at Costco but they no longer carry it.  I add dried fruit to it and it makes a delicious side dish.,positive
I've Always been a fan of Brunswick Kipper Snacks. These were purchased to save .80 cents off the price per can at the local supermarket. Having a case of 18 is wonderful. It's Great mixed with tunafish for sandwiches.,positive

Box arrived in awful shape and old looking! Don’t waste your money.,negative

"I rented the film (I don't think it got a theatrical release here) out expecting the worse. The previews made the film look awful. I was in fact very surprised, it was well worth watching; it was loosely scripted, almost like an ensemble piece of film. It had some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too scathing. It is flawed, mainly by the awful soundtrack of bludgeoning 'comedy' effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an altmanesque or Larry Sanders way.At the moment it is the fashion to be critical of Jerry Springer, he is also an easy target. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and it would be proclaimed 'the worst film ever made'. I recommend this film for anybody interested in the show. A flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film.",positive
So much more economical than fresh and still high quality of taste.,positive
"The new formulation of this product does taste better. Kellogs accomplished this by more than doubling the sugar and halving the fiber. The thing is, I wasn't buying it for the taste, and now it has as much sugar per serving as some kids cereals.",negative
These are definitely hard to get use to bc they don't work like normal types of tweezers. But they work well.,positive
"Haven’t seen this cereal in stores since I was a kid… Now Amazon sells it! If you love Cinnamon Toast Crunch, you’ll love this one more.",positive

"Only complain is that the plastic pot got deformed. But most importantly —  shipping was quick, secured packaging, delivery service was handled with care, and  the plant arrived so nice and fresh.",positive
This is a delicious bacon alternative. Of course it's not going to taste exactly like bacon. I add it to everything from wraps to scrambled eggs. I love buying from a family company as well.,positive
"Okay, so it was never going to change the world, and it bombed at the box office, but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those films I fell in love with as a child (the BBC showed it a few times during the 1980s and I happened to have a high quality VHS tape in the machine - lucky, that!) and watched endlessly. I watched the DVD last night and sadly, time has not been kind to this would-be blockbuster. Either that or I've just grown out of this kind of broad, dopey humour. Come on, when Schlesinger is so desperate for laughs he gives us close-ups of novelty underpants with 'amusing' slogans, what can you say about the cast or screenplay?Certainly, it's ambitious, interesting, unusual and sprawling, but it's never once laugh-out-loud funny. I'd describe it as a children's film with some 'adult' overtones - you can safely let your youngsters watch this, despite the 15 certificate. They won't get the drug references, so don't worry about it. I had a pleasant surprise when I realized I'd forgotten just how catchy both the title song and the song-writing truck driver's 'Everybody's Going Faster, Faster' song were, not to mention the town of Ticlaw's patriotic anthem. The whole cast give commendable performances, the photography is crisp and captures the mood of the various locations perfectly, and there's a real time capsule feeling about the fashions, the cars, the gadgets (especially the dashboard-mounted drum machine), the interiors and the pop-culture references - I was more than a little surprised to hear the nutty bum in the bank loudly telling everyone ""I'm OJ Simpson!"", particularly now Simpson's legal tangles have overshadowed his sporting achievements. The snag is, there's almost no plot to speak of, it's way too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to elicit many genuine laughs. I wish I'd left this one as a pleasant memory.",negative

My favorite easy cake is 1 can of solid pumpkin, 1 egg, 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.....mix by hand and pour into a greased bundt pan....350 degrees fir 35 to 40 mins. Turn out of pan onto plate while still hot....moist and perfect without frosting.  But often bake them as a sheet cake - cool - frost with cream cheese frosting.",positive
"Couldn't use it because it arrived to late, but it's really nice",positive
I have tried numerous Old Fashioned mixes with varying results.  This is by far the best i have found.  So good that i must purchase it by the case. Everyone that has tried one of my Old Fashions has loved it.  Simply mix 2 parts Bulleit Rye and 1 part Barsmith over ice in a rocks glass and you will not be disappointed.,positive
When you just want a great tasting old fashioned quick this is the way to go.,positive
I came across Javy as I was looking for a replacement to the costly Forto Coffee shot. Java is perfect. Lasts my wife and I a whole week. Way more affordable. Tastes great We mix ours in with milk. Only downside is it's messy.,positive

"Without question this is by far the best honey I've ever tasted and I'm a honey lover!  And, if that weren't enough, the cap and honey release on the top is absolutely amazing!  I've never had 'any' brand previously that so well controlled the flow of the honey coming out of the bottle.  I'll not only buy it again, I'll share it with both family and friends.  On top of all that it's amazing value.  What's not to like?  Way to go guys!  You hit this one out of the park!",positive
Sent this to a friend who lived on the other side of the state as a get well soon gift. She loved it! :) The price was very reasonable compared to sending flowers or candy bouquets!,positive

These were delicious. They are very addictive!,positive
I love this tea. It is a high quality tea with a very potent flavor. A small amount goes a long way. I love the seal to help keep the tea fresh.,positive
"The pumpkin tea has a nice chai flavor.  I'm not a fan of pumpkin flavor at all but my family enjoys this one.  The Cinnamon Vanilla, on the other hand, is yummmm!  Really love that one!  The cranberry has a good tart flavor that reminds me of cranberry bread.This would be a nice gift set, but we aren't sharing --LOL!",positive
love the flavor of this,positive
"Thankful you carry this product, it’s difficult to find good Limburger cheese.",positive
Am using this for making coyote paste bait. So far it has been amazing for that and making fishing bait.,positive
More like little stale Pita  chips than crackers.  They have a decent flavor .  But these are not my favorite healthy cracker .,negative
It has Mango and Pineapple in title but did not taste  either flavor in the tea. Bland,negative

"This is not the first time we are buying this item. The first time we noticed some bugs after a month and gave the company benefit of a doubt … however this time we opened the box upon delivery and notices that the flour bugs made holes even in the Amazon box already , as you can see on the picture.Don’t get me wrong it’s a great flour , but it would be even better without creatures crawling all over.P.S. Amazon issues a refund immediately upon reporting an issue.",negative

"Product is excellent.  Packaging SUCKS. Cans Dented, ruined other items inside box",positive
This arrived on 06/25/2021 at 3:45 p.m. at 92 degrees and shoved in side a very hot mail box.  The cheese was very hot I don't feel safe eating it.  I want this replaced and shipped FedEx.,negative
"I eat 30 grams a day, it's Ike my special treat, and part of my breakfast. They're crunchy and very yummy. Be advised, they weigh the bags in 'servings per bag' so, it takes like 4 bags to 'even out'. Totally worth it.",positive
One of the best tasting flavored. de-caf coffees I have ever tried. It's a little pricey for regular consumption.,positive
Product arrived fresh and in good condition. Price was a bit high.,positive

Amazing bf loves it,positive

love getting this big box online,positive
I sent this to my daughter and she loved it. There was a large assortment and was the perfect size. There was a sweet note inside and we are now following them now on Instagram. I would recommend this as a gift or even for yourself because of the variety. I will definitely send this to others.,positive

"Excellent coffee; will order again.  Hard to fine good Kona these days.  Wish they had more tee shirts available, as I'd be happy to help them advertise.",positive
"I was introduced to Teff when I was diagnosed with gluten sensitivity. It is a bit bland, but I add REAL HONEY or Coconut oil, to give ita nice flavor, with a splash of Almond Milk, for Breakfast. It can also be used as a thickener for soups. Give it a try!",positive
Great bc it  contains no nuts ! I ordered this because of allergies I can't use anything that contains traces of nuts. This doesn't.,positive
"1lb will run out very quickly in about a couple of days (2-3 days)...the package is small; not much powder is the container.this egg powder is made by drying out the liquid eggs into powder (science).it is a very very light powder so ALOT OF WATER IS NECESSARY...3 cups of this powder would give you the equivalent of one egg...so this is how you would easily run out of this product very quickly.  I don't eat eggs everyday. but i purchased this, as I was going on vacation/camping and would have no way of getting fresh eggs or the ability to refigerate eggs so this was the reason i purchased this.the taste isn't bad.  but like i said i expected more uses out of this product",negative
What can I say cheaper then the convenience store.,positive
"These taste good, and the price is fair. I've tried other brands, and I think these are excellent.",positive
"Surprisingly easy to mix in hot water. I researched several matcha green teas (both culinary and ceremonial grade) before purchasing this one, and I'm happy with my choice. I add a half teaspoon in hot water and the tea mixes with little need for stirring.",positive
"Great pricing for a worthy product. I do not have much money and neither do my friends. My friend used my gift to her to invite friends to her ""home coffee bar"" for the holiday. It was great! I appreciated that the gift arrived in time to make party arrangements. YUM!",positive
"Had a friend in sunny Florida who loved these, so I’d send her a case when the price was right. You’ll usually get these delivered in the box that is pictured. It may be safe, but I tried to remember to request it be shipped in an Amazon box to ensure it got there safely. Some people complained they received leaking boxes, but I don’t think she ever got a damaged shipment and I sent them several times.",positive

Great product.  You can tell this is the real deal.,positive
"I have been drinking this tea for years now, ever since I was introduced to it whilst living in England. Can’t drink anything else. Gorgeous ruby red color, deep lovely flavor. The price on Amazon can’t be beat. I usually bring it home with me when I visit, but I always use Amazon when I run out. Thank you for stocking  this wonderful tea.",positive
"Taste like pasta,  great!",positive
Only thing is that gets me is the sticker shock. Really good chips but a bit pricey for me so orders are a once in awhile type thing.,positive
Favorite and great in my water,positive
"Extremely sweet. Ok for adding in to a recipe (like as a sweetener/flavor to cranberry sause), but way too sweet for any other use. There's other products that taste better.",negative
Completely fresh.,positive
"Let me start by saying that I'm not a coffee snob nor brand loyal.  I like a medium roast coffee, and I'm always looking for a better price.  I've been buying the same ""store brand"" for over a year, and I've been satisfied with the taste and price, but don't like having to go to that store to stock up since I buy little else from it.  When I saw this brand on Amazon, and discovered that it was two cents cheaper per pod than what I'd been paying, I decided to give it a try.I am not disappointed!  Because I use a flavored creamer in my coffee, this brand has a slightly stronger taste, but still within the medium blend range, which was a pleasant surprise!  I average 3 cups per morning, and it only took me 2 days to decide that this was going to be my new coffee!  I have a few pods left of the 'other brand', so I intersperse one every couple of days so that I use them up.Saving time with Amazon delivery, saving money and a more fulfilling taste - this find is a huge success!",positive
Love the flavor of this coffee and smells awesome too. Tastes a little like butter rum but not sweet. The aroma when brewing is fantastic.,positive
Love this. Great taste and the hint of Orange does the trick..,positive
This product was disgusting. The candy was hard as rocks. Could tell by looking at it that is was VERY expired. Shame on whoever thinks it is acceptable to sell such garbage to someone. I'll be requesting a return/refund.,negative
This gift was for a female family member and she said it was just right in terms of sugar content and excellent.. rave reviews.,positive
these worked like twice before they just started jamming up the machine and no longer dispensing coffee.  save your money please.,negative
DISGUSTING!!!!! I accidentally ordered 2 & then read the reviews but couldn't cancel my order. Don't feel like trying to replace it but I couldn't even eat it! The eggs don't even look like eggs (maybe the yolk IF that.) And it tastes horrible...DO NOT BUY IT!!! You will be sorely disappointed and waste your money. If I could give it 0 stars I would. I'll had a photo of my other one when I can stomach to smell that crap again.,negative
"I don’t know about anyone else, but when I buy coffee pods in bulk, they tend to taste chemically and weird. My husband got these for me because I LOVE Andes Mints, and I may be obsessed with this coffee. 10/10. Would drink everyday.",positive
Very happy with the product! I used it in a special Neem facial mask. I was also sent a good Turmeric Tea recipe from the company which I'm very anxious to try. It sounds sort of like Chai Tea but with much better health benefits. Thank you!,positive
"Loved the tea.  Expected it to taste overwhelmingly oregano but it didn't.  Very pleasant flavor and so good for one's health.  Have read that it is antibacterial and a source of omega-3 fatty acids and also good for muscle spasms, joint problems and respiratory issues.  Will buy again.",positive
Great flavor - like melted cinnamon candies.,positive
I did not dislike anything about this product. Made a wonderful dinner.,positive

"Purchased for our son.  He loves the flavor it adds to his water.  A bit strong, according to him, but still well-liked.",positive
"I bought the Mccormick brand because they're known to have quality spices but I was pretty disappointed by this coriander. I opened the bottle and it didnt have much scent.  After I crushed it with a mortar and pestle it still didnt have much scent and the flavor was very bland. I dont know if it was old, left in the heat or cold for too long, poor crop or what but I feel like I should have went out on a limb and tried a different type/brand. Wont be purchasing again.",negative
Opened a packet and inside molded beef jerky.,negative
I am not big on sweets but I do like a little something every once and a while. These are great. Just like regular Oreos but thinner. They are easier to eat and just enough sweet for me. The mint flavor is good on these. I love how easily they break when I bite into them but they are still sturdy enough to open up and eat the filling if that is your method. Good stuff from Oreo.,positive
Much better if you go pick out your own hot.  Overcooked and old if delivered.,negative
Was great!! Me and my kids love the candies.,positive
"Excellent maple syrup. We tend to be picky about Maple Syrup, having lived in Maple Syrup country for more than 25 years. We have ordered this many times and have always been satisfied.",positive
"This is the single greatest movie I have ever seen. Davey/Mr. Slaussen is simultaneously:1) Tortured about his talents (e.g., ""I can control it; I can! I shouldn't have to hiiiide it! It feeeeeeeeeels good!"");2) Desperate to make friends, e.g.,""How's the soup?""The soup is very good.""""Would you like some crackers with your soup?""""I'd like some more crackers, please.""""How's that?""""Yes, the soup is very good.""3) Proud of his accomplishments (e.g. ""Pretty neat trick, huh?"")4) A ladies man (e.g., ""You're so pretty. Why don't you like me?""); and5) Sometimes, very, very angry (e.g., ""You can't get away!"")Connors should have received an academy award for best actor for this movie. I mean, who was possibly better?! Tanya Roberts rocketed to the stratosphere following her performance in TT. It's a wonder not all of the stars of this masterpiece did not go on to have brilliant careers. I highly, highly recommend this film! It's available on amazon.com. Everyone should own it. Make a night of it and have a bowl of soup while you watch.",positive
It's something brown to spread on toast. Does not taste anything like Nutella. It is edible however. But barely.,negative

"These SweetGourmet GoLightly sugar-free assorted fruit chews were delicious. Lots of fruity flavor. I saw that some people posted getting a lot of peach flavored chews, but I got a lot of orange flavored chews. I guess it just varies. They did not give me gas, laxative effect, or anything tummy related. They did make my blood sugar be a bit high, but nearly everything does.",positive
"I don't like leaving bad reviews, and I don't know how this product gets good reviews. It flat - out tastes exactly like a Slim Jim when cooked. All 3 of my guests remarked the same.It looks good and they take pride in the quality of ingredients, but when it comes down to it, I was embarrassed. Trust the other reviews if you want. Maybe it was just the 4 of us.",negative
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz. She is so excited about their adventures together, she decides to make a tv show called ""Showtime"" starring Tray (the cop) and Mitch (the detective). But that's just the funny part. The rest is strictly suspense and action. There is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns. While playing LAPD on the show and doing it in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have quite an adventure in this story. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a seven or 8.",positive

"Beautiful bean seeds. Got close to 100% germination! Thanks Todd, I will be back. Oh, and a huge thank you for all the follow-up tips and tricks for sprouting the seeds. Very helpful.",positive
As advertised and fresh.,positive
This is the best yogurt ever. The creamiest and smooth with superior flavor. I have had all of their flavors. All of them are great.,positive
These coffee pods work great for us and has the coffee we trust. These were bought for my mom and she loves them.Great value for the money,positive
Perfect funny gift for my Marine!  She got quite a chuckle out of the reference of Marine’s being called Crayon Eaters!,positive
I use on my cereal every morning and the zip lock closure really keeps them fresh. Tasty to the bottom of the bag.,positive
I work loooong days and this is such a wonderful treat to come home to.  Thank you for making dairy free and organic caramels!,positive
I always tried to keep garlic powder in the house. And I use it quite a lot in the cooking that I do. So I'm always trying different brands and when I find one that I really like I'll stick with it for quite a while. Until I get again to try something new.,positive
This is the best Italian dressing and much cheaper than buying it at Olive Garden.,positive
"Great product, quick delivery, great price.",positive
This was a gift for my mom's birthday. Everything that she has thus far tried was either very old that is past its prime. The nuts and apricots were molded and had a musty smell. The sausages were greasy and tasted rancid. the cheese were marginal at best. On the bright side the crate that the food was packed in was very nice. I guess I paid $70+ for a nice crate. Very disappointed.,negative
Great flavor. Nespresso never disappoints!,positive
Yessir,neutral
"I love the flavor of these and that there is no added sugar. Very tasty, healthy drink.",positive
"Well packaged item was in one piece when it arrived, love this candy so pleased .",positive
tasteless and crunchy just as advertised. They emailed me afterwards saying that if I posted this review they would donate $10 to a charity so here I am.... (I'm not sure if they were being serious about the charity thing since I only paid $10 in the first place for the chia seeds),positive
This flavor is hard to find in retail stores nowadays. So happy to find it on Amazon at such a great price too.,positive
Kids favorite chips.. however something happened with packaging.. when I opened the box ( peeled the tape with my fingers)  6 bags had slice marks as if they were cut with a box cutter or scissors... there were hot cheetos everywhere and I had to put the unopened ones in a plastic bag ... other than that issue and losing 6  bags everything else was fine... kinda disappointing tho.,negative
"Puts and *end* to my chocolate cravings. And then halts sweet cravings. I mix in with smoothies, yogurt or just a teaspoon with pyure organic stevia sweetener (also sold here on Amazon for great price).",positive
I absolutely love this product and put on just about anything especially fish and chicken dishes!! Right amount of sweetness and heat! U will not be disappointed,positive
"Came earlier than expected always a plus for me! I love lemon powder grew up always having it in our house. Perfect for cooking, homemade sauces and especially adding it to Ramen or any type of noodles!",positive
"This stuff is incredibly convenient for traveling, but not worth it. We got it for our 1-year-old when we went on a road trip so she could get her milk in while we were out. She would take a few sips and then push it away. After several of attempts, I finally tried it myself. It's disgusting. Super chalky and the chunks do not dissipate no matter how long and hard you shake it. It doesn't taste like milk. Yuck!",negative
"These are two 8oz bags of cheap orange slice candy that you can pick up at any grocery store for 99 cents each. These are not from any type of Fruity Nut House company, well maybe a nut house for thinking this is worth $7.95. Do NOT buy!",negative
"The topper is fun not traditional, no one else has one with two guys. Companies need to get with it the gays are here to stay",positive
"This flour is perfect for making roux for gluten free (GF) gumbo.  I tried other GF flours and flour blends, and none comes close to this one.  Having grown up in Lousiana, I like my roux dark and flavorful.  This one really works, and gets that authentic tasting Cajun gumbo flavor.  (Of course, you have to add the right smoked pork sausage or seafood to get it perfect!)  I browned it on the stove with extra light tasting olive oil, using the same proportions I would for wheat flour and oil.  I have not yet used it to make a ""dry"" roux.",positive
"These are my favorite. Midnight snack, snack for a car ride. Buying in bulk is the cheapest way to go.",positive
"My grown daughter loves this spaghetti and has a hard time finding it. So, being the ""Amazon Queen"" that I am, I found it and she is now getting it from me on the Subscribe and Save program. Her kids love it and can fix it when ever they have a craving, it's so easy to make and they like cooking it. The order arrived fast as usual and this is a fabulous price!",positive
These taste great and are vegan! Yum.,positive
I have been satisfied with this even though it comes in a tin container. Normally I buy in glass containers.,positive
i like them well roasted;@most of them were.they are the best!!!,positive
These gluten free products are very good! I have used them for a variety of breads and pancakes. These mixes have improved a great deal compared to the ones I purchased 2-3 years ago. I find that being able to make bread at home makes a substantial savings over the GF bread bought at the store.,positive
These took me to my younger days! Dreads and delicious. I was afraid they would be old. Lol,positive
I haven't test how my body would react but it does taste good.,positive
The Chia seeds were delivered on time and I like the health benefits.,positive
The best jerky around. If you like your jerky tender - THIS IS THE ONE TO GET!!,positive
"I love Som Sleep because after I consume a can, I instantly go into a deep slumber that relaxes me in the evening. I can’t wait to purchase more products from Som Sleep!",positive
This gum is delicious wish it was still the same price would order more,positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by this! It's delicious! 😋I microwaved it in the container, then added a pat of butter and a splash of milk. I know it's good without the butter and milk; that's just the way I've always eaten my oatmeal. I'll even go so far as to add sugar! Whatever the mood or what it's mixed with, it's great!Enjoy!",positive
"Been eating these for about 5 years now.  They're awesome, and you will not be able to tell that they are rice.  Promise!",positive
I love this! Clearly my favorite spice and I use it on most everything!,positive
I love these. Received a gift and they were wonderful.....however they do not ship well. They arrived as one solid mess as opposed to individual pieces. My advice is to get them from a Trader Joe's store and not by mail.,positive
"Love it,",positive
A great fix of Maryland snacks for me in SoCal!,positive
the black tea the  best for me! the flavor and health benefits.,positive
Great wedding cake topper. Cut the stakes off after the wedding and now using as decoration and sweet reminder of the day!,positive
Didn't have time to exchange before I needed it so I used the very short stick I was left with. It was upsetting to receive such a cute broken item. The glitter doesn't come off.,negative
"I used this fondant in a tester cake I did for a family friend. The fondant was easy to work with and formed up nicely with the addition of tylose powder. I will be using again! I use this brand for most of my fondant work as it’s easy to work with, not too expensive, and always delivered quickly by Amazon!",positive
"Coming from Brooklyn, I personally would not consider this product a bagel. It tastes good but, to me the taste and texture is more like Italian bread.",negative
MSG is in this rub. Sorry but this is not something that needs to be in a rub and I will not continue to purchase.,negative
Liked very much. Better than the basmati that I get at my local supermarket.,positive
BEST instant coffee anywhere.  I'm a big coffee drinker but HATE instant coffee. This coffee tastes like a quaility brewed cup. You will not be disappointed.,positive
"Product was packed very well, the nutmeg is wonderful and have used seversalnuts",positive
Expiry date is only one month,negative
"If you want a delightful berry taste with a smell that permeates the kitchen, this coffee is for you. I’ve experienced no issues with brewing these in my Keurig. They work and taste perfectly every time.",positive
"Ordered 7/17/20, delivered 7/18/20.  Use by date on box 8/1/20! Love the product but not sure why they are shipping nearly expired product.",negative
Such a great gift for all those healthy snackers on your gift giving lists all year long.,positive
"I warm it up and use it as shave oil for my head. It leaves my head feeling soft and smooth afterward, and minimizes irritation.",positive
"I was a little concerned at first.  Bold coffees are often bitter, at least to my taste buds.  But I read about Death Wish Coffee in an article recently (most caffeinated coffees), and a friend told me he'd tried it and liked it.  So, I thought I'd give it a whirl.  Kind of pricey, so I bought the smallest quantity available.  When I opened the sealed bag, the aroma of coffee about knocked me over.  I was sure this had been a very bad idea.  I put a K-cup in my bag to bring to work with me.  Much to my surprise and delight, it tasted very smooth, not bitter at all.  Granted, I mixed in several packets of S&L and two French Vanilla creamers, but still, it was much tastier than I thought it would be.  Will I use the rest of the K-cups?  Definitely.  Would I recommend it to a fellow coffee drinker?  Most definitely.  Will I buy more?  Probably not, considering the price tag.  Maybe it will be an occasional treat for myself.  Also, I'm not at all ""wired"" like a lot of folks said I would be.  Interesting considering the amount of caffeine per ounce.",positive
"I'm addicted to these! I put one in my coffee, so it melts it. It adds the perfect amount of sweetness, and I don't need any additional sugar.",positive
"I usually like Stash tea, but this variety had an “off” taste to me.  I like to try different teas— this time it was a disappointment.",negative
My toddler hated these. I’ve tried different ones and none of the tickle his fancy. They leave a weird after taste.,negative
Good prompt service delivery.  Good selection of different coffee.,positive
If you want a good cleaning out buy this tea. The stomach pain happens as its gathering up backed up food in your intestines but it's worth it and your stomach will be flat as a board.,positive
Nice green tea with some taste. Better than others I have tried.Will order again.,positive
Tastes like dirt. Noone in my family liked it and it didnt have that aramatic scent that most Basmati rices have.,negative
"Great chocolates, took awhile to ship. Sad that I won't be buying them anymore because they now force 20 dollar shipping? What a joke. Free shipping or make it reasonable. Lost this upset customer.",positive
"My third time getting this three pack. First time it was great, last two times the batches were coconut oil and water. Very weird. I'm not sure if it's getting shaken too much in transit? Reconstituting it doesn't work well. I miss my coconut cream! Tried gently warming it which does mix again, but when cools it turns back into room temp coconut oil.",negative
Ordered these the first time and they were great. The second time they came they were wet and sticky out of the package. New gummy bears that ate wet and sticky out of the package are gross.,negative
This coffee is such a nice difference from other local flavors. It’s not too heavy tasting nor does it leave a bitter aftertaste when drinking.This is one coffee that I can drink black or add a tiny bit of milk to and it will still have a nice taste.,positive
Normally I prepare my food from scratch but I will purchase some things pre-made if they are healthy and delicious and affordable.  This hummus meets all three.  I'm hooked. Will probably never bother soaking and cooking the chickpeas ever again. Perfect flavor blend to my taste.,positive
I was little leery about buying some powdered products but when I tasted the products they all taste like what they are supposed to.,positive
"Great for sandwiches, a Medium cut is best.",positive
I like how smooth it is even when refrigerated.,positive
Husband says they have a strange flavor but he likes them. We will purchase them again,positive
"I bough those before, and had good ones, but when ordered second time, I got completely different brand, with old  and unpleasant  taste, everything went in a garbage can.",negative
I want to pay for this with my SNAP benefits and don’t understand why I can’t,positive
It needs a great deal of high percentage cacao chocolate added to it to make it work.,negative
Wish it had more of the bbq and pizza flavors  but still a good deal,positive
Awesome! Great tasting!,positive
It is exactly what I needed for my skin and hair,positive
"They are the most reasonably priced dried figs and did not have any of the bad experiences other reviewers left.They look ripe, tasted sweet, and I like the packaging. Would totally buy them again.",positive
Make the absolute best spelt bread and pizza dough.,positive
"I did not buy this on Amazon. I was anxious to try. Depending on your expectations, you may be very disappointed. When I think of beef stew, I think carrots, potatoes, and beef in a beef gravy. This product is not that. They also make a vegetable stew.. The beef stew is just the vegetable stew with some small pieces of dried beef thrown in. Gravy tastes like peas, with zero beef flavor. Although not mentioned that it contains peas, it is about 50% peas. Not necessarily a bad thing, but not what I would call 'beef' stew.",negative
I bought these because the ingredient list was so good. I was hoping for something like a gummy but it's like a punch out of a fruit roll up. Not for me.,negative
Nothing better than coconut oil for popcorn,positive
Just what I needed to add that wonderful flavor needed in Kung Pao chicken/beef recipes. I ground it in my coffee grinder.  Easy and delicious.,positive
Love the taste. NO SUGAR! Many people may not like it. It has a slightly pungent taste as you start chewing. Rich dark chocolate flavor takes over as you chew. Good nutrition,positive
Definitely my go to box mix.,positive
Another overpriced item you should avoid! I have tried different ways to prepare it but no luck. Tasteless just bad!,negative
great product but I have gotten these on sale at shop ryte for 1.00 because they d ouble the 50cent coupon included in the boxes.,positive
"I ordered these 5/16/21, and they were delivered 5/18/21. The expiration date on most of the bags were summer 2020-ALMOST A YEAR past the expiration. And they tasted that stale, too. What a sham.",negative
"very cool....bloody ears,feet. brains/hands. the children just loved them. little creepy for the little ones so that is why I bought lollipops too",positive
"Eating these feels like biting into pure salt.  Wish they made a ""low-salt"" version for people who like to be able to taste the fava beans.",negative
"I had these in London and loved them. I splurged when I found them on Amazon. Unfortunately, they tasted like melted plastic. I threw them away as they aren’t returnable.",negative
wanted to try them.  been looking for a low carb English muffin.  but will not buy again way to much money.  they  tasted good,positive
"Delicious, just what I was looking for for my popcorn.",positive
If you want to low carb it this flour is a great substitute. It tastes like regular flour and doesn't have as much carbs. Good to have in your kitchen. Love the resealable bag!,positive
"Love that I'm able to get real Cassis - Great product, quick delivery.  Will order again and again.",positive
Best alternative to beef jerky. Great flavor and texture.,positive
I love this ginger juice.  It is very good.  As I've gotten older I and I not always in the mood for juicing the ginger myself and this is almost as good as fresh from the root squeezed in my home juicer.One Love,positive
The worst cookies ever! Expected much better from Pillsbury. Nothing good to say about these.,negative
"I thought life was over when they stopped selling this at the whole foods on my city, then I found it here. The best coconut oil there is hands down. I use it for hot oil treatments, to seal my hair, to moisturize my skin and as a pulling agent for my teeth. I love it.",positive
"I have bought this pie kit at Wal-Mart grocery many times and it is truly delicious.  But, I only paid $4.79 for the pie kit.  It is very, very good, but really.....$39.00 + $11.00 shipping...??  No way!!",positive
Love Green Mountain Hot Apple Cider. My wintertime pick me up drink!,positive
I like the fact that this decaf is Swiss Water processed! It tastes SO good!,positive
I love this sauce! I have Interstitial Cystitis (IC) and its is the only tomato sauce I can tolerate.,positive
"My husband and I really enjoy alot of the Samyang noodles/flavors, but this one is a no go. It does not taste like the original hot chicken at all and the cheese flavoring that is included is not good.  It has a weird off putting taste. Will not order these again.",negative
"These candies hardly look like ribbon. It's just a blob of candy. I also ordered the mixed bag from the same company and they were poor quality too. And, did NOT include any of the little flower ones.Both were all busted up and powdery. Super disappointed and can't return.BOOO for YOU Primrose.",negative
"This is the real Chilean Sea Bass. I received 4 to 5? They are a nice size, no need to trim off bottom(Skin) like Salmon because it’s not there. I cooked mine in my air fryer frozen and not frozen. If frozen I do 17 mins & non frozen maybe 12 mins. Use a temperature gauge because everyone’s Air fryer has different temperatures. I have Gastroparesis & this doesn’t affect me at all. As a matter of fact, it helps with my GI issues. The buttery flavor that Chilean Sea Bass already has, its ok to use a butter spray on it then sprinkle w/various herbs. Salt should be limited with this fish. I use Onion Powder, Garlic, Basil & seasons of such. I will continue to order.",positive
"This is a good brand which I used to find at my local grocery store, but now have to purchase through Amazon. It has a great just right ""Goldie Locks"" flavor, not too light, not overpowering. Add it to desserts, candies, beverages including tea and coffee, cocktails, and European/American recipes of the Victorian and older eras, or Middle Eastern recipes. Delicious! I like finding the 20 oz. bottle.",positive
loved this candy in the past was awful this time around and threw it out,negative
I really love the flavor of this coffee. I also love the eco-green packaging.,positive
One canned had leaked out. The cardboard box was all wet. Not the shipping box just the inside box.,negative
It was ok it was cheAp and broke before putting milk in the cup,negative
"I’m very disappointed in the flavor and scent of this nutritional yeast. I don’t like leaving bad reviews, but honestly this is barely edible. The scent alone is a huge deterrence.I’m lactose intolerant and eat a vegan diet. Using nutritional yeast in my dishes has become a staple. I’ve tried several over the years, and have never had a problem with them.Honestly, I think that something might be wrong with this yeast. I would return it if I could, but it’s not eligible for return. I would consider keeping it just for the added nutrients, but the tastes is bland. Just tastes like I added powder to my popcorn. No cheesy, yummy taste that I get from the other brands that I’ve tried.I’ve included a few pictures, so you can see this close up. Hope you found my comments and photos helpful.",negative
"Great flavor, perfect for traveling",positive
This licorice is gluten free and incredible! It is the best red licorice I have ever had. Yum!,positive
"I like the mints. They are tasty, small and seem to have pure ingredients.",positive

"Love the taste. Does not taste artificial, taste really good and refreshing",positive
"I missed the last campaign and didn't get these cookies, so I went on a hunt for them. I found them here and the seller was fast, the price was great and the cookies were still fresh and in the original boxes. Overall, I would say I had a great experience with this seller!",positive
we used this product for sangria,positive
"if you love salt these are for you! I love pretzels, but I love pretzel salt even more.these will fix my salt cravings. Mine were not really broken up, but that was fine when I eat them at work I tend to break them into small easy to snack bites.",positive

"The individually packaged pieces of chocolates wrapped in the gold wrappers had leaked the juice contents of the the chocolate. They were defective. There were blue wrappers also, but those were not as bad, meaning not in all instances.The chocolates were a gift to an elderly, 93 year old, man in an assisted living facility with Parkinson's Disease. The manager at the facility, which is  located in Washington, discarded the chocolates. I live in California. I am not in a position to return the chocolates.Can you resend another package of Ghiradelli chocolates.",negative
MIX it with something else and you will be stoked.,positive
"Kodiak Cakes are the best pancake/waffle cake mix that I've ever tried, compared to Mrs. Butterworth's mix or any homemade mix that me or my wife have ever conjured up. I was a little surprised that these taste so great considering they are advertised as a healthy cake. The mix is very easy to prepare; you simply add water and follow the directions on the package for fast and delicious cakes. Nothing more to say than that.",positive
"One of really powerful mixes that challenges even guys used of spicy food. Love it, but a bit too strong so we doubt we will use it all up ;)",positive
I have been using this for over 6 months now and it is THE BEST gluten free flour you will ever find!!! I use it cup for cup in typical recipes and it works great! They also have a biscuit recipe on their website and you can make biscuits that are mouth watering!!! I will never use anything else!!!,positive
"Wish I could have given this 0 stars! When I opened my package I saw that it was half full to start and had a watery liquid consistency and not an oil. When I opened it, It was like a brick sitting in water. I couldn't even stir it. When I did break it up it was runny and NOT creamy at ALL. How can you spread something to eat it if it is NOT even spreadable!? Total waste of $14. I am on a fixed income so I can't be throwing my money away. Had I known I'd have just saved my money and ordered the one I normally do. What junk!!!!!!",negative
My only problem is that I eat a whole pack and a half before bed and then I can't sleep from the sugar high.,positive
Container was damaged when arrived. There were some in the bubble wrap.,negative
[[VIDEOID:29abe69788137aa3a6ea482ba1506c8e]] Only received one box and not 3,negative
Awesome price for the stuff I love.  Please be there when I run out.,positive
This arrived open and spilled in the box. I would use this item.. I want a refund or replace this item immediately!!!!!,negative
Has value. Easy to use/mix. We usually use milk instead of water. Works for pancakes/bisquits/waffles etc.  Packaged well. It does need to be packed well. I've had several come in that are dented at the seal. This can compromise the LT seal.,positive
"I have been getting Lavazza from Amazon for a couple years and the price fluctuates wildly. Sometimes it's better to order six cartons of ten cups, sometimes two 32 cup cartons, other times a single 64 cup carton. It pays to check the price per unit. The coffee is superb!",positive
"I purchased this item to ensure that I had enough snacks available for my crew. I was NOT disappointed! The flavor, the freshness and even the portion size was amazing! My lil wrecking crew loves them, so yes I will be reordering more soon!!",positive
A childhood favorite of mine.Delicious.,positive
"The taste not what expected. It was our first time trying these. We did not eat the bag. Just a few bites. This was a small snack size bag. Unless you know and like these, I would not recommend trying them. Overpriced for a snack bag of chips.",negative
"Try this coffee, it's really good.",positive
"always need to have these in stock. love them, great price & prime is great for when we don't remember to order in time. thanks!",positive
I am diabetic so adding these sugar free syrups to water is great.  Tastes wonderful and coming from me that’s huge.  I absolutely hate diet sodas because of the after taste,positive
"It's nothing special. Was expecting more illustrations and some funny inserts here and there... a few fake wine stains and a couple illustrations.. otherwise it's the same hagaddah I got FOR FREE from the grocery store for years. Also, the translation probably isn't accurate to Midge's time. Pretty disappointing.",negative
"While a little on the sweet side, these are by far my favorite GF table crackers.",positive
They taste like authentic viejitas.,positive
"This is the first time I’ve ever been unsatisfied with Ben & Jerry’s. It was bland and nowhere near as good as it sounds. I still love Ben & Jerry’s in general, though.As much as I don’t like it, I must admit that it is much better than Halo Top’s peanut butter ice cream.",negative
"I love the taste and ingredients of this product. However; in my last delivery, the item had a punctured seam. At the time I thought it was the carton packaging so I wiped clean. Now I see the damage. It notes that this is not a returnable item, but I think it needs to be replaced - not a cheap product.",positive
Full of flavor and NO added sugar. These are my favorite nut pods to date!,positive
"Although I've only recently started buying this product through Amazon, I've been buying this product for at least two years and changed to buying from Amazon when my local store stopped stocking the big bags. The figs are always moist and flavorful and stay that way as long as you seal the bag after use.",positive
Not from concentrate. One of the best coconut waters out there in my opinion.,positive
"This drink is very good, but a bit too caramel tasting for me.  I use it for my own Keurig ""recipe"", add one pkg of the caramel machiatto, a heaping tbsp of regular hot chocolate mix then use the machiatto k cup (at 6 oz setting) and one southern pecan k cup (at 6 oz setting). I do have a sweet tooth, so I add some Equal packets  Fills my travel mug and I take it to work.  It's yummy.",positive
"These are far from a nutritional snack, with that said, if you have a hard to please (food adverse) child these are a golden ticket! I bought a case of them so she can have one everyday!",positive
"Great product, I keep this on hand for cooking and table use.",positive
"Packaged well, fresh, lots for the value. Impressed.",positive
"YUM!  Very tasty, fancy little treats.  Much better than making them yourself, super convenient.",positive
"Barry's tea is the best! Strong black Irish tea (from African farms, not Indian like English teas). Gold blend is the best Barry's. If you like really strong black tea, you'll find this delicious.",positive
Yum. We had on family vacay in Scotland so ordered.some.for whole family for holidays,positive
Sent this to my son w a gift card for birthday- he said it was very good!,positive
Loved them! They didn’t come melted at all. The only complaint I have is that they are half a peanut. I will still be ordering again.,positive
The BEST iced tea out there!!!,positive
"I would not order again because the bottle, even though it was sealed, was leaking",negative
I bought this as a Christmas present for a diabetic relative who loves Jordan almonds. He says they taste great and he thought they were a very nice gift.,positive
Actually better due to packaging than what can be bought in the store. No metal aftertaste. I love plain tomato sauce because there’s so much you can do with it. Make your own marinara or pizza sauce. Make your own thousand island dressing. Just use it plain. Perfect size to use for one or two people.,positive
"I recommend this soup. It's delicious, filling, and nutritious. Some people might find it too spicy or salty, but I like it that way. It takes about 20 minutes to make. It's really easy, too. (Just boil 4.5 cups water, add soup mix, bring back to boil and cook for 12 minutes.)One 6-once package makes 4 1-cup servings. I'm on the Weight Watcher's program and have found this product to work nicely in the program. (It counts as 2 points.)",positive
"My cousin, friends and I truly enjoy a nice glass of wine...Fast-forward, trying to live a MOST healthy lifestyle = sacrificing regular wine rituals.This tea when cooled down to room temperature or slightly above, is a great substitute for dry vino/red-wine.Make sure you let it steep for the max time recommended and if you put it in a wine glass no one would be the wiser at a party. One bag per glass suggested, to enjoy this rich dry flavor. Not sweet at all.Waist line is slimmer and days are more productive thanks to this healthy alternative.Cheers.",positive
"This is the best beef base on the market, a must buy!!!!",positive
Every time they orange. Even when I ask please not orange. Why there are no other colors?,negative
We love this coffee. So much that we created a subscription so we never run out. Especially because our local grocery stores never ever have it.,positive
"Sorry but these are dry and taste horrible - do not recommend, was a waste of money!!",negative
"adds a great new twist to grilled meatsveggies, etca friend from California turned us on to thisand I was so happy to be able to obtain more!",positive
"Love these and really into forbidden rice.  These are winter staples for us.  Just wish these super ramen would cost less.Update 2023: Now 10 of these packets cost $30.  Seriously?  Guys, this is RAMEN noodles.  Sure, it's a higher quality rice-based ramen.  But it's RAMEN.  I've bought this 10 times on Amazon in the past.  But at this kind of stratospheric price, I have to go to 1 star and you can find me over on vitacost.",negative
"the pancakes are delicious and if you sprinle on potato/ fish before frying, the fries turn out golden n crispy. very nice product.",positive
"I purchased the Peppermint Mocha creamer directly from their website & besides being expensive, the flavor was just not that great. It's sweetened with sucralose which isn't good & I had to add peppermint extract to get that real mint flavor. I also added heavy whipping cream to calm the sweetness then you MUST use frother to fully blend it per their instructions. Their coffee is amazing but their creamers are a no for me.",negative
"If you like flavored water, you'll love these. Nothing artificial and just the right amount of flavor. Orange may be a bit weak but they're all good.",positive
"I tried many Caesar dressings and this one is the best in flavor.Definitely a better price at Wal-Mart and at grocery, but it is only for pick up not delivery at these places.",positive
Excellent product. Very fast shipping.,positive
Great coffee! Wanted a coffee and was impressed by flavor.,positive
What a treat. I let the sachet steep for about 5 minutes and a wonderfully fragrant tea is ready. It is reminiscent of Red Hots candy. You don't need sugar or honey- this tea is totally sweet all on its own.,positive
We liked everything about the product.  It was devoured quickly at the Christmas Even smorgasbord!,positive
Canning salt had hole in box,negative
"These were open when I got them, And tasted horrible",negative
I use it to make my pumpkin spice lattes,positive
Beautifully made and tasted! Very worth giving a try!,positive

"As hard as it is for me to believe, with all of the awful reality shows out there over the past few years, this one has to take over the top spot for worst one yet. I am still wondering if this was actually just a spoof done by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann were still alive I'd be sure he was behind this. Can a rock band stoop any lower than has INXS to do such a shameful thing as this? The premise is simple and moronic. Audition a bunch of karaoke rejects to become the new lead singer of INXS, to take the place of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hits later, the band commit the ultimate act of patheticness by subjecting themselves to auditioning a bunch of talentless wannabes to be the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years past its prime. So they trot all of these awful singers (I thought American Idol had its share of doozies) who do atrocious renditions of just about every classic (and predictable) rock song imaginable. And then they cut to the INXS band members who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates. You could see better (and more original) rock performers at just about any night club in any city in the world.It has all the usual uncreative elements of every other reality show. Lame reality participants, lame interviews, lame host/emcee, lame ""judging"" of performances, and the lame booting of one participant at the end of each show. Can these shows get any more predictable? It's clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the band; a last gasp of hope at rekindling their lost stardom before they are finally buried into oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had any shred of dignity when alive, has to be rolling over in his grave. Not that INXS were ever a great band, but I had no idea they were this pathetic. If INXS are at all representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all, dead.",negative
"I suffer from fibromyalgia, and a friend recommended taking moringa to help manage the pain. After extensive research, this brand seemed to be the best deal-good quality at a reasonable price. The color of the powder was nice and green, so it was fresh. The taste isn't bad, and shouldn't be a big deal if you're used to 'green' things. It came in a resealable package which was nice, though I put it in a storage container for easier access. One thing to note is that the powder does not really dissolve easily, so I would recommend using a blender or good quality shaker if you want to put it into a drink/smoothie-there's really no stirring it in. I've been using it for a couple weeks now, (starting with half of a teaspoon) and I will say that I've noticed an increase in energy and mental clarity when I take it. It also seems to take the edge off of muscle pain. I will continue to take it and update this review if there are any changes. I would buy from this company again.",positive
"I said it last year and I will say it again, the presentation is so beautiful. The marshmallows are delightful. I think you have a customer for life :) PS I wish I still had some left to take a picture :)",positive

The fact is I ordered the new look and fresh cinnamon organic Ceylon and what I received was old product put in somewhat a new bag which is made out of aluminum which is bad for the human body. The bags are made out of aluminum plastic which in my guess is chemically coated. And I added the cinnamon powder to my food and it taste old.and has a different color than my new cinnamon powder. 🙃 this too me is old product they've been trying too get rid of and along came me to get 8 bags that only good for 2 yrs. This product no good I'd rather send all back but afraid they'd just stick it in a newer bag and pass it of as fresh. Sincerely Mr Peacock 🙏 ps I only speak the truth weather it helps your business or hurts it I don't fabricate the products. So if Amazon wants me to lie I sorry but I don't lie for anyone or any reason. So you do what you want But for me I tell it like it is and if it hurts your feelings oh well get over it. It's not your money your wasting its mine. Sincerely Mr Peacock 🙏 that's fine I can't return this awful old crap that I was screwed ordering you couldn't tell it was old food sorse until you opened it to taste it this is how you get ripped off. So now I know never order anything you put in your mouth on Amazon cause when it comes to health you only get 30 days to make sure it's fresh and not old. I will submit this too the right people and let the law handle the company I ordered from. Have a good day. Sincerely Mr Peacock 🙏❤ be safe . Ps I ordered 8 items of this not 1 item but 8 bags and it expires in 2 yrs you can't use this much in 2 yrs. Just learn to ready the small print before you purchase large quantities,negative

"Easy to use for coating candies and in fondues.I use this instead of chocolate because of the high temperatures in the summer.This coats well, but occasionally I use paramount crystals to thin it a little so that the dipped chocolates don't have too much coating.I have used this product for the last three years and still get rave reviews for the taste and consistency of the product.",positive
Awesome sparkling water and flavor.,positive
"Yummy, mixes very well. I add to cereal, berries, yogurt, smoothies , even pasta.Great deal!",positive
We are by no means a gluten-free family but I bought them out of curiosity and wow. They taste exactly like original. The texture is spot on. The crunch is almost the same. These go a little crisper which was great tbh. I would buy them again just to keep sales up for those who are gluten free and Oreo can make their profit and what not to keep around.You’re welcome for being the Guinea pig,positive
"I put a big heaping spoonful in my protein, breakfast drink, every morning.  Has improved my digestive system, immensely.  I am very happy with this product.  I was able to correct my problem without taking probiotics.  Probiotics caused me discomfort, more than good.",positive

Tiny boxes! Chalky taste. Flavor not as good as three wishes brand or even forager brand. Don’t know why these are so hyped up by every paleo food blogger I follow. Glad I tried them on sale so I can never try these again and forget about it.,negative

Finally  a healthy mac and cheese product that actually tastes good!  I have tried many different dairy free and gluten free mac and cheese brands and they all are like eating cardboard.  The All Clean Foods Mac and Cheese actually tastes like mac and cheese but much healthier.  Way to go All Clean Foods.  I have also added veggies  (I like adding frozen peas) for a little variety.,positive

Best tasting sauerkraut!,positive
"This is my favorite blend for my Keurig and so I decided to try the decaf version. There is a significant flavor difference in the decaf verses the regular. While the regular is rich, bold and strong, the decaf is weak, soft and lacks the bold flavor of the regular. I had a regular cup one day and a decaf the next and the difference is remarkable. Because I bought here and not straight from Keurig, this may be a fraud. Buy straight from Keurig if you want a guaranteed good, consistent cup of coffee. And if this company does buy directly from Keurig, I would expect them to make this right.",negative

Smooth strong coffee. All I have now even beats what we got from Trader Joe's! Bought a manual grander just to use with this. The first Marley Lively Up! we got was from Whole Foods in an 8oz bag for bout $10. This is 4 times the amount for about 2.5x the price. Because it is so good I don't have any problem using a 2 pound bag!,positive

"I usually LOVE these white mulberries, but, this time they arrived very dry, hollow, and super crunchy and flavorless. I could eat them like rice Krispies but I'm afraid they might be like this because of bugs or laying in a bad location during the harvesting or shipping process. It's really surprising because they're usually amazing. Too bad",negative
I can’t access my camera to show you the disappointing product that was sent. I’m getting a refund thank goodness but I will definitely not be ordering gift baskets from Amazon again. Who knows what is sent out to people if it’s a gift.,negative
This has NO CINNAMON FLAVOR. Disappointing.,negative
This milk is great. I've tried canned coconut milk from the store and didn't like it. I'm following the Whole 30 program. I'm drinking my coffee black but occasionally I put this in. It's very creamy to me and a treat. I've used it recipes too. I will buy again and again.,positive
Bought these for my kids who are in basketball right now. They also play soccer and football. Quick refills to get the electrolytes they need during games. love the concept and worth every penny. My kids love to put the pods in the containers.,positive
So good and the shipping was on time...,positive
I just like to say that this coffee smells and tastes really good. My inky issue I have with it is that three after I got veryAnxious and I really can feel the effects of the caffeine. If your sensitive  to caffeine like I am I would definitely reduce that amount . I thought being that it’s a clean coffee I wouldn’t have those jitters but I did. I purchased the dark roast and the medium roast. I made the medium roast the following day I still get some of the caffeine effect with a headache and a little nauseous. I think it might just be me. I typically don’t drink coffee. I wanted the full health benefits from the full caffeine coffee and not the decaf. I will be making this on the weaker side . I do think that it tastes really good .,positive

"I just got this today. It was a gift for my husband. The seal was undone, its a twist cap and someone has already twisted it open! There was no tamperproof tape on the box it comes in. The bottle looks nothing like everyone else's. It's got a faded look. This broke my heart! I was looking forward to giving him this with love. Now I'm stuck with something that was already open and in what looks like used or misprint condition. I'm stunned and saddened I'm stuck with this unfair item.",negative

Nothing close to the photo. 3 white flowers and greenery.  See photo. The bouquet is pretty but the product info is very misleading as to what you get.,negative
"These candies are a nice size. Overall they are unique and I am well pleased. Beware that they don't come with a stick so theres nothing to blow out on the cake. But they do make for a cute and fun appearance. The stick part broke easily but it was after the party so it was ok, just be cautious when handling. I just hate that I had to buy a whole pack of numbers just to only use 2 now I don't know what to do with the rest of the numbers.",positive

"Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) sci-fi movies in Hollywood. But long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land. The story is a basic femme fatale premise, nothing new or enthralling. Verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences, which instead of defining our main character and his situation, are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot. The screenplay was solid, the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story. What really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting. Jereone Krabbe was amazing as the ""tortured artist"", and the supporters were very good as well. Also, Jan De Bont's cinematography adds at least some life to the film, helping to make Verhoeven look at least capable as a director.6.5/10* * 1/2 / * * * *",positive
I love this chai latte.  It is impossible to find any place except at Amazon.com.  I add a teaspoon of CoffeeMate creamer to the  latte that makes it taste really good and I like the 60 calories per cup.  Keep selling this product.,positive

I would recommend, though, that you look in the international foods section of you supermarket before buying online. We found them at the regional chain (Ingles) for $2.35/9.5 oz package. So far as cooking, I find them for be at there best after no more than 3 minutes in boiling water. Less, it you're adding them to a dish that might be reheated.",positive

Great Coffee. drink it everyday. I love San Francisco Bay Coffee.,positive
"We’ve never seen a coffee that is like this, with this process to make a cup, so we were interested to try it out. The coffee itself wasn’t great for us. It had a bitter taste and also slightly tasted like cardboard. It’s also hard to judge how much liquid is in the cup without it overflowing if you’re not using a transparent cup. I can see how these would be good for travel if you know you won’t have access to a coffee maker, but this particular one wasn’t good for me.",negative

I love Chimes Ginger Candy and this Orange flavor is amazing. I carry this in my purse when I get a sweet craving and they help curb!

Where these sticks were normally firm, this batch was soft to the touch.Page states the item is returnable but it is not.

"I bought this specifically to add to my dogs's meals as it was suggested to me by a breeder it would be good for their coats. They love it!  It smells delicious and I tried it on toast instead of butter. It was creamy with a light flavor. Not as strong as butter. I bought the 54 oz jar. Needs no refrigeration. The label says ""100% less cholesterol than butter"". Of course it is as it is not an animal product.",positive

"It's a completely different experience than what you get from teabags or the coarse powder of cheap loose leaf black tea. It's an amazing tea to drink plain without milk, sugar, or spices. Some cautions though. You have to brew this somewhat properly. Just below boiling for about 4 or 5 minutes. With cheap bags you can just toss it in and forget about it. Usually it will just run out of flavor before anything bad happens. Not here. Tea brewing is generally more forgiving than the online guides make it sound, but if you left this stuff in boiling water for 10 minutes, it would probably be undrinkable. For making cha/chai with spices and milk, I prefer no more than about a 50/50 mix of the cheap coarse powdered cut leaf stuff with this. The cheap stuff has an extra bitterness that helps the tea flavor cut through the spices.",positive
The flavor is horrible; and sadly every color tastes the same. Nasty,negative

"If I could give zero stars, I would. So excited to receive and tried 3 in a row. All exploded in my Kuerig, made a mess and provided less than1/4 cup of coffee/grounds. Never had a problem with any other brand.",negative
This fruitcake tastes and smells old. It’s almost to it’s expiration date.,negative
I did not know they made this flavor till I saw it advertised one day. These make a great mid day snack or an addition to my lunch at work. Very good flavor & definitely not too spicy for those who have a hard time with heat.,positive
"Great coffee, will buy from this company again.",positive

I love these candies and they arrived fresh and delicious!!,positive
Nothing to dislike about this. Tastes great. Great price. Excellent for people with internal discomforts. Will definitely buy more.,positive
"I had heard the coffee rubs were good, I just wanted to try this, and the under $10 price tag was too good to pass up.  This rub is fantastic on pork, chicken, and beef.  I will be buying this again.",positive
"I love this chai....it could use a bit less pepper, but I still love it.  It is a bargain in a small container.  Except for the pepper, the spicing is excellent.  I will be buying this chai again.  After a few weeks, I am addicted.  I need to stir the chai each time I use it so that the pepper doesn't dominate.  Now, this is the only chai I want.  It is too good.  I have other chai in the cupboard; but it is boring now!",positive
Love it but its takes some help to  get the taste I wantA little soy and terriyaki helps,positive
It was first time we tasted natto. It is great! Thank you for the opportunity to buy fresh natto. It was packaged perfect.  We will be back: for more:),positive

"My wife said she loves it, so scientifically speaking, this must be the best boba. I have no clue, I don't use them.",positive
Excellent variety- see pictures of all that came.  There was nothing we didn’t like included snacks and candy.  Expiration date was good on it all at 3/2022 or later.  Very happy with the care package.,positive
I enjoy the quality of this brand and having 100% WHOLE Wheat.,positive
Well not much to say its creamer! Not to sweet and not bland it's a great taste in a handy carton that sits next to my coffee pot. Buy my creamer from Amazon all the time. This item was part of a large order and there were no shipping or product problems at all.very happy with the seller and the product.,positive
"It’s very fresh, and very delicious after cooked. Good price. I really love it!",positive
Good value & quality.,positive
"I've tried just about every store bought spaghetti sauce - always looking for that perfect one. Then I finally got around to Newman's Own Sockarooni sauce. I was skeptical, what with the silly name, but was getting desperate. Well, that was 10 years ago, and I've been hooked ever since!I still try a new sauce from time to time (like those tv chef sauces that've come out in recent years)but I always return to Sockarooni. Thick, Hearty and Flavorful.Try It! Maybe you'll get hooked!(No, I don't have a vested interest in Newman's Own - I just know what I like.)",positive
Love Worcestershire sauce. Zings up all my recipes.,positive
They are great!  could smell them before i even opened package.  Everyone will be happy with there Christmas present.,positive

It tasted like the regular candy but sugarfree,positive
"UPDATE: Viva deserves 5 stars for customer satisfaction. They stood by their guarantee, which I admire! Thank you, Viva. Great company.If you're buying this primarily for the health benefits and you trust every new headline about the latest super-food and its life altering properties, you'll love it. If you're buying this because you want the absolute best chocolate taste, you'll be disappointed. Here's why: cacao just isn't produced because it has superior flavor to cocoa (google them if you don't know the difference in process). Even the finest cacao will never have the truly deep rich notes of high-end cocoa products like Il Pernigotti Amaro (Italian) and Valhrona (French). I prefer the Italian version, although its virtually identical to the French, but both have a MUCH richer, smoother, deeper chocolate flavor, and both require FAR less sugar to be palatable. In fact, you don't even need to add sugar to Pernigotti Amaro unless you're the type of person who drinks 2 or 3 pump starbucks and adds a bunch of sugar to everything. For those accustomed to drinking high quality black coffee, you'll find that it takes very little time to adjust to a sugarless hot cocoa drink with nothing but water and Pernigotti Amaro. I use a 16 oz cup but leave plenty of room at the top so that it's about 1-3/4 cup water, which I first heat to a boil in the microwave (takes 2:30 in mine) and then combine with two heaping tablespoons of Pernigotti Amaro cocoa powder (note: they spell it cacao, but it's COCOA). You have to learn not to overfill the cup with water to leave room for that much cocoa, and it takes 1-2 minutes of artful stirring to fully dissolve, but its absolutely worth it. TIP: add both spoonfuls of cocoa at once by dumping them on top of the hot water, then insert the spoon from any side, keeping it low in the cup, and stir somewhat vigorously in a circular pattern while slowly moving the shaft of the spoon into the huge mound of cocoa; don't pull the spoon up until all of the cocoa is sunk and dissolved -- be patient, it will dissolve (some people advise adding a little water to the powder first to make a paste before adding the rest, but I found this ridiculously difficult - just learning to stir the powder is much faster and easier). I leave the spoon in the cup angled above the handle and held in place by my thumb so I can re-stir it a few times while drinking. Cocoa naturally wants to settle when you add that much, but the richness of the drink is so good its worth having to deal with a spoon. The result: a cup of hot cocoa that is so good it'll make you crave it like coffee. I tried multiple times to downgrade to Viva Labs cacao in my drink, but the need to keep it lukewarm to preserve the health benefits, and the sub-par taste at any temperature mean that I'll never buy it again. Why would I when the Italians and the French have clearly dominated the top-end of this market? Somehow I doubt I'm going to live longer because I drink lukewarm Viva Labs cacao instead, and I'd rather live a few hours less if the chocolate tastes that much better. My hat is off to Viva Labs for bringing a healthy drink to market though, and I have no gripe with the quality of what they have produced insofar as cacao is concerned, but titling it ""The BEST Tasting..."" is misleading, even if it is the best tasting of all organic cacao products. I just felt those seeking the best chocolate experience should know what they're missing. I'd rather have my money back so I can put it towards buying more Pernigotti, but I won't be so cheap as to send Amazon back an open bag. Maybe I'll save someone else the hassle. Attached: a picture of Viva's cacao on the left, Pernigotti's Amaro cocoa on the right. Viva seems to have altered the online image of their bag to make it look darker.",negative
I bought the product for finishing wood,negative
I'm so excited about the mixed fruit flavor! I've been buying the mango one for a while but this is even better. The value for money is also excellent if you buy the 8 pack.,positive
These barely color eggs. May be ok for other uses but haven’t tried,negative
"I usually make my own rubs, but when I don't feel like it, it's Hank's to the rescue!  Recently did a large wedding reception (pork butts for pulled pork) and used a couple full bottles of Hanks' KC Royale to rave reviews form all.  It's great on pork chops, pulled pork, ribs and chicken (pieces or whole).  A good spicy pepper kick if you use it heavily.  Low salt, you can still dry brine if that's your thing.",positive
I ordered this sugar for brewing kombucha at home and my booch absolutely loves it!! Great quality sugar is making a very good brew! I'll absolutely order this again.,positive
So pleased to have found a sugar free energy drink that doesn’t make my glucose level go sky high. Being diabetic with chronic fatigue it has been hard. So very please that Rowdy Energy take my fatigue down to moderate and no 2 hour nap needed. The flavors are great. The Peach Mango and Cotton Candy are my favorites of the sugar free and the Cherry Limeade and Orange Citrus are ones I like as well.,positive
I've bought several of these and will continue to buy them. I love them and there delicious,positive
The free gift was perfect.  I absolutely loved it and the sugar arrived perfectly! Thanks!,positive
"Delicious ! After trying the sampler pack, I definitely found my favorite. It is a bit cheaper to buy variety on Amazon, but if you are looking for one flavor, it’s a bit cheaper ordering directly from Vegan Dream.",positive
"This habanero sauce is great! It's not that spicy so you can really taste the pepper! I put in not only in hot dishes (beef, chicken, fish), but I also season my salads with it! I would highly recommend it!",positive
"I recieved my box and when I opened it there was ants all inside! I immediatly put it outside and started looking to see if there was an open bar, but I didn't find anything. It's unfortunate because I was excited to eat them. What do I do?",negative
Bought this for my granddaughter as a stocking stuffer. So cute and everyone thought it was so unique.,positive
My favorite oat meal,positive
"Amazon sells these for less than the price printed on the package. I buy these r 4 bags at a time and often eat my way through a bag in a day's time.  No shame though, since they're one of the healthier snacks on the shelf.",positive
The best - I love them!,positive
Haven't tasted it yet. but was VERY disappointed by how much was in the pouch. I paid over six buck for something that will only produce about four cups of tea. the picture is wrong. the bag is SUPER small and the amount in the bag takes up like a third of its space......,negative
"I hated brining in creamer into work because our fridge is NASTY and I wouldn't know who was using it. I bought this as both a coffee addict and a hospital worker who is in dire need of caffeine that doesn't taste like hot bean water. This coffee mate french vanilla bottle DELIVERED. Perfect amount of sweetness and flavor and is shelf stable so I can keep it above my desk, not horribly high in calories and the pump is FANTASTIC, easy to use and smooth so the creamer isn't shooting at you. Highly recommend for both taste and ease of use.",positive
Making Vanilla Extract,positive
"What's there to say? The product has very good flavor, plus being in powder form it doesn't cool down the coffee. No way to elaborate any on this. Ok I could say that the packaging is attractive, it's easy to pour, the shape of the container is easy to handle, etc... but I won't, but I guess I already did! ooops!",positive
"I have tried a bunch of Matcha brands and this is by far the best. It gave me a boost of energy and tasted great. As advertised, it wasn't bitter at all.",positive
Biggest bag of tea that I've ever seen was very impressed and surprised by the size,positive
Most beans were uniform in size and made great home made extract.,positive
First time trying these and they are delicious..wish I could order a whole case..,positive
"I was worried when I purchased this since there were so many other brands to choose from.  I made a glass this morning and WOW it is perfect!  What a great deal and great taste!  This bag will last a long time, it is actual loose tea with the spices and VERY good quality.  I will definitely be buying more of this stuff!!  I am using my french press coffee pot to brew and filter the tea and it works perfectly!",positive
"Wish there was a bigger bottle, lol.",positive
This is the best flavor out of all of them in my opinion. I can't find them locally and these are just as cheap as in the store.,positive
"The capsules give an easy to make great espresso with great taste, and the foam top is enjoyable.",positive
I tried these because living alone I cannot drink a half gallon of orange juice fast enough before it spoils. I flip one of these open every morning for my breakfast and it works perfectly. They taste good.,positive
"The best Yerba product available. Perfect for terere, mate, and mate cocido. Good size for the price.",positive
Hasn't been a full month and the kefir quadrupled in size! I now have it transported from a quart jar into a half gallon jug. What did the trick was adding molasses to the sugar water. 1 teaspoon per quart of sugar water and it really took off.,positive
Excellant but and loved the fast delivery .,positive
"We bought this for a gift, so we haven't tried it yet.  It was boxed so nicely and securely, we can take it on our road trip as is for our hosts.  I plan to order another one for us.  Such a great set at a good price!",positive
"I thought this product was the perfect product - it was exactly what I was looking for.  However, upon receipt my excitement turned to disappointment.  When I opened the package I found it was completely infested with weevils. The item is a health risk and completely unusable.  The bag sat in my house today before I opened tonight to use, I hope they did not infest the rest of my house.",negative
Simply the best all-around for your frying needs. For those that don’t fully understand “hydrogenated” please read the description in the attached picture.,positive
I buy this one to two times a year and it lasts once I transfer it over to large glass mason jars.  Perfect for noshing or on a charcuterie board when we have guests.  Just can't get enough of these,positive
Delicious  Never spillage  Great quanity and quality.,positive
I wanted to try the Hydrangea Leaf tea for its health benefits.  Many teas leave an after taste in my mouth that make me feel more thirsty and not at all looking forward to the next sip.  I thought I would have to put up with another leaf tea that tasted like alfalfa  BUT this is a gentle green taste with a finish of sweetness that leaves my mouth moist and relaxed.  A true joy for tea time.,positive
"It arrived earlier than expected,was packaged well,licorice was soft,fresh and well priced,I love that a shop in America imported this,as it gets quite pricey ordering from UK sellers,but this is my favorite licorice.",positive
"I love that there is no salt.  I have bought one from BJ's Wholesale, which had a lot of salt.  I have bought that small one at Trader Joe's, less salt then the Bj's one.  This one is huge and not salt so I can add what I need!  It is perfect!  This was my second time purchasing it and I will continue to get it from here!",positive
"Saw this in Wegmans then bought this 12 pack online. Quality did not disappoint, although box was a little beat up. Good dark chocolate especially for 3 bucks a bar.",positive
"Delicious, and healthier than half½!",positive
"I keep two of these flavors in my car and I always feel confident knowing I have them in case I need to freshen up before going to see someone or if I forgot to brush my teeth! Great taste and the best part is that I know it is not affecting my teeth negatively but actually helping promote good bacterial growth. The flavor lasts enough to do it's job and as I don't like to chew gum a lot anyways, it works for me.",positive
"Crunchy, fresh tasting, and great chocolate covering -- low in sugar, too!",positive
Delicious cannellinii beans! I highly recommend them!,positive
The Brownies were so delicious that I felt like I was doing something wrong when I was eating one! The taste is amazing. Does not taste much different from a regular brownie.,positive
"Every piece of gum was rock hard, possibly due to being old. It was not good or enjoyable.",negative
This is so good! Want to eat the entire jar!,positive
These noodles are fantastic! They’re my new favorite thing. My only complaint is the wild swings in the price. I’ve seen it anywhere from $72 to $24.,positive
It was a little chalky but had that subtle acai flavor and 10g of protein is a lol for how big the packets are so I was impressed,positive
"Good quality, tasty, buttercream mints in variety of ""denominations""",positive
Did like it,positive
Just as advertised. Use a lot of these. - Like this brand,positive
Anyone who has bought this product directly from Nuwati Herbals knows the powerful affect it has on the sinuses. The product I bought from Amazon does nothing. I would highly recommend you purchase this directly from Nuwati Herbals in order to get the correct product. What I purchased is no good. It shows it came from Nuwati Herbal but I’ve had this product before and I know what it does. I was very disappointed!,negative
Fantastic product.  I needed to make a 100% sugar free jam and this did it.  Detailed instruction under peelable and resealable label on container.,positive
"This stuff rocks my world! I use cocoa for a wide variety of things ranging from vegan cooking to homemade makeup, so you can imagine I go through it faster than even the average chocolate hound! I'm happy I made this purchase because it has everything I was looking for, basically. It comes in a generous amount, it has a quality taste and it's organic for a good price. It will be awhile before I finish off this bag, which has a convenient seal that actually works btw, I'll be purchasing this product again.",positive
Sicken sweet with sugar in it!,negative
My kids LOVE this cereal.  They won't eat anything else.  They have been out of stock for a few months now - hoping they come back soon!!,positive
"Really bad taste, ended on the sink.",negative
I started buy this when I was too lazy to make from scratch. This tastes the closest to homemade than any other. Our stores used to sell them seasonally but I haven't seen them in 2 years. I'm so glad I found them here. I think this is the 6th purchase in around 3 months. My 10 year old loves it. I add in 70% Cocoa chips and the yummy slight bitterness of the chocolate counters the sweetness of the bread and just makes it taste perfect. I'm sure I'll be be ordering many more times.,positive
Love my green a white fusion tea!,positive
I have a few barbecue recipe's that call for Smoked Paprika but it was difficult to find at our local grocery store.  I ordered this product and recently used it on Barbecue Ribs.  It added an extra touch of flavor to the ribs.  I'll order again.,positive
"I love this stuff.  ""Clean"" barbecue sauce is so hard to find, and its usually too time-consuming to make my own.  I love the flavor of this stuff-- rich but not overwhelming at all.  I just wish it was available via Prime more often.",positive
I love this honey. It is unfiltered and unheated. You have to eat it with a spoon. It tastes great and is great for you.,positive
This is certainly the very best flour I have ever found. And the delivery service was remarkably fast.,positive
"I kept hearing about Moxie, the famous state soda of Maine. Moxie is referenced in video games and online. Curiosity got the best of me so I bought a 12 pack on Amazon. It arrived extremely quickly and VERY well packaged.The taste?  It's an interesting flavor. I'd describe it as a blend of root beer and Dr. Pepper. I found it to be very refreshing.Other reviewers described the product as bitter, like drinking gin or something, but they are exaggerating. There is a very small, almost unnoticeable bitterness, but that's only on the aftertaste. You wouldn't even notice it if you weren't looking for it.The soda is moderately sweet like root beer.  It's a well made delicious cola that harkens back to another era.  If I had access to this soda in local grocery stores, I'd buy it on a regular basis. People In Maine are lucky to have Moxie in their state.",positive
"It had no flavor, extremely bland.",negative
Cost too much for the product was not worth it,negative
"Great stuff, didn't know I could buy it in bulk packages like this. very tasty salsa",positive
"The strawberry is undoubtedly the best flavor of sour punch straws. Sadly, they don't seem to sell them anywhere in my new town, so I decided to buy in bulk and have them shipped.  Shipping was awesome, received it within 2 days.If you are a sour punch straw junkie like me, you can't go wrong ordering this product.",positive
These candies were recommended by both my dentist and dental hygienist. I have severe dry mouth due to medications that I am on. These candies do help to stimulate saliva and they are supposed to help prevent the dry mouth from causing decay. They taste good and are easy to eat. And there are no Calories or sugar. What more can you ask for.,positive
This stuff tastes like it's been cooking all day. So good!,positive
I got these to give as thank yous for people - glad I tried one before I gave them out.  They taste TERRIBLE. I threw the entire box out.,negative
This is a great value on subscribe and save. It has strong rich medium to dark roast flavor and is better than I expected for the price.,positive
There were some products in it that weren't low carb. But overall it was great!,positive
The chocolate was cracked and tinged with a white film.  Some of the gummies are too chewy and hard.  I would never recommend giving these as a gift.,negative
I open box and it was leaking,negative
Great and crunchy cookies,positive
Pricy!,positive
Very dry. Had to steam it to make it edible. But I guess you can expect that for gluten free.,negative
The pistachios were old and tasteless. Never buy it again. Had to throw it out.,negative
"Frontier Maple flavor is way better then this, Frontier is stronger, yummy, thicker and  way better then this product.  This product is watered down with way too much alcohol  in it.  And no refund.",negative
"Besides the box being such a small amount of cereal, like 3 bowls maybe. The flavor is terrible, doesn’t taste like chocolate, it’s super chemicaly. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone",negative
I don't like the size at all. I am a fan of the pur small gums and was looking for new flavors.  I saw this fruit flavors and bought it without even realizing its soooo big. I don't get why they do tthis. Now I am going to cut each piece in half to make it more comfortable.,negative
"This is the best dried fruit I have ever had. It is tasty and crunchy. Not chewy and gummy. The best thing is there is nothing artificial in it and it meets all my allergen free needs. Try it in the Tropical fruits too, YUM!!!Karla",positive
The flavor is not great. Was hoping for a gingerbread taste but didn’t get any. Was not easy to spread neither.,negative
I wish I could review the product but amazon sent me an opened/damaged bag of this very expensive lupin flour and has stopped responding to our correspondence. Please send me a new bag so I can actually use the stuff,negative

I was very happy with my purchase.  I was not expecting all the little extras that came as well.  I would encourage anyone to order from this site as I would surely do again.,positive
Have it every morning with a little half and half.,positive
"I'm one of those mean people who limits sweets, even for kids, so this with milk is desert and I'd never give it for breakfast. The times we do have desert, like when we all sit down to watch a movie, this is a reasonably low-toxin choice.",positive
"I will NEVER buy these again. The first time, they were fine, but this batch had rancid nuts, though it was well in-date. The return experience was ridiculous! Now you must package and return to the nearest UPS office which is 20 miles round trip- that's an hour plus $5 in gas. ( formerly it was my nearby PakMail) OR they will come to you BUT there must be an adult present. WAYYYYY too much inconvenience and cost to get my money back. I did it, of course. it is sitting on my porch, but NEVER again. Won't take the risk. I'll go Costco to get the nuts.",negative
"It's one of two popular natural sweetners.  I tried Stevia and it let an after taste in my mouth, I didn't find this with Monk Fruit sweetner.  I'm on Keto Diet so I use the liquid which I like best, lower carbs and no papers to put in the trast.  I'm diabetic so I have to use alternative sweetner or none at all.  I use it for cooking also and it works well.",positive
"Delicious flavor, taste just like a “regular” blueberry muffin.",positive

I love it! No complaints here. The quality is satisfying.,positive
Brought two set one came in good shape,positive
"I always enjoy my annies gluten free products, especially mac and cheese. I like to know I can have some annies gluten free mac and cheese on stand buy, I did when we had a blizzard. I am gluten free and I know that annies is natural ingredients so it wont hurt me. if your gluten intolerent other preservatives and things can also hurt you stomach. so yes I love my annies gluten free mac and cheese.",positive
Still every bit as good as in my first review (which follows).This is a second-hand review because I gave this as a birthday gift to a friend who was wistfully remembering how much she loved nibbling Turkish delights and drinking tea while at the camel races. She called me the next day to say how clever I was to give her two boxes as they'd gone through the first one the night before while telling stories and sipping tea. I'm clever and she's happy--it's a win-win.,positive
"Very weak, flavorless coffee. I purchased this package because of the great price but you get what you pay for.",negative
Package was not left in a parcel pickup... it was left on our porch which was perfect. Don’t know why they listed “parcel pickup”.,positive
Once with eight o'clock; can't drink anything else.,positive
Love the flavor of this healthy food!,positive
These are quite delicious and can be easily put in a toaster to add some crunch to them.  They come individually packaged in clear plastic and I keep mine in the freezer until ready to have one.  I will order more when these are gone.,positive

"Me and my husband are HOOKED on this honey! We eat it straight up most of the time but sometimes we dip the club crackers in it and it is bomb! We only have one issue and that's the packaging. The last 2 times were upside down and spilled some in the box. It was easy to tell cause it looked crushed.We love this honey and will continue to purchase if there was a little more care as to deliver. Other than that, we're satisfied taste wise.",positive

"Thanks so much for ruining coffee for me....From now on, When I walk past Starbucks I laugh & laugh at all those poor suckers that think they know what “Strong” coffee is. I’ve always used coffee to help me sleep or relax (I know, completely backwards).  Never expected to find a coffee that could actually make me WAKE UP!  So when I prepped my French press for my first cup of Death Wish Coffee, honestly I was pretty damn skeptical.So imagine my surprise when 2 hours later I’m wide awake & cleaning the house like a mad woman!I can’t thank y’all enough for producing such an amazing game changing coffee!!!",positive
I honestly came in with no expectations!! The entire bag was devoured in 3 hours. I am finding it hard to resist the temptations to buy another bag!,positive
lovè these,positive
"Two Rivers Coffee Flavored Coffee mixed box has such a great variety of flavors. Every cup, so far, has been amazing. Majority of flavors are ""unfruity"", which is my preference but probably 1 out of 10 has a fruit base. Even though, they've still been delicious. I've brewed using an 8oz, 10 oz and 12 oz setting and they come out equally delicious no matter the dilution.  I would definitely recommend.",positive
"These were a gift for my six year old daughter,  they are well made and the perfect size for her to play with.  They come apart and go together easily.",positive

"I've always taken my coffee black but I have a preference for cold /iced coffee and I like to treat myself to one from Wawa once in a while which is the only time I like a little bit of a flavored cream in it. I recently purchased a carafe for cold brewing coffee so I can have it whenever and I flavor it with coffee Syrups.. This time I happened to get A Caramel Pecan flavor and wanted a French vanilla flavored Creamer to go with it. I can't stand to use actual milk or anything to creamy. I came across this and the mixed reviews had me skeptical, but the extra Caffeine sold me, and I'm glad it did!  I tried it in hot coffee 1st and it clumped a tiny bit but blended just fine with a little extra stirring. The flavor is smooth and between this and the coffee syrup, I didn't even need to put not 1 Splenda in my coffee. I also tried it in afternoon Fruit Smoothie I make everyday and it have a body in my energy without altering the flavor of my smoothie. So, this morning, my cold brew was ready to try. As soon as I put this in the coffee it all completely clumped at the top and wouldn't stir in, so all I had to do was pull out my little single serve blender and blend it for 3 seconds and it was perfect and not even inconvenient since I didn't have to bother with my full size blender, again added with the syrup it gives a smooth, good taste worth that extra push of energy I seem to need in the A. M. And I can now enjoyed a delicious cup of iced or cold coffee that rivals any of the ones I was paying $6 for. This is how it looks in the cold brew... It gave the top a nice fourth from the blender",positive
Love this stuff for adding to protein shakes.,positive
"I bought these since I like to have a couple snack options at work.  I work in an ER & I get called in during the middle of the night sometimes.  When it gets busy you don't have time to sit down to a meal so energy drinks & different snacks is what helps keep you going.  It has a very tiny amount of heat so to me it is nothing that is noticible, just gives a little better kick than regular cheddar one.  Also cheaper than Family Dollar for exact same thing.",positive
Classic taste at a value price,positive

"I love Stash brand teas and these did not disappoint.  I thought buying 100 bags might be too many, but I'm using them pretty fast since the tea is so tasty.  They came loose in the box which made me wonder about the quality, but they are definitely Stash quality.  Will be buying these again.",positive
I love this tea!  I’ve been drinking it for years.  The company sells an awesome selection!,positive
Love this oat bran. I use 2 tbs in my morning smoothie. Less calories and more protein than 1/2 cup rolled oats. Great price. All good!,positive

This delivery was disappointing.I love dried peaches and your previous 4 or so shipments were the very best I have ever had! The last shipment received a week ago were not the same quality. Every piece is very dried up and not as sweet. I am concerned about whether or not I should reorder from you again. Contact me re this. Thanks,negative
This is NOT genuine. This is flavorless and seems diluted. I should have checked other reviews as I see many have said same. Waste of money.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!,negative
"Lay's potato chips are the best in my book as I have tried many brands. Amazon really packs items very well as I thought they might have got broken up as I had heavier items in my order but they didn't.  They were fresh, well dated and I have ordered them again as they are a great value on Amazon compared to what I would pay in the store.",positive
The candy some if it was real hard  and taste old. Majority I threw out because I couldn't give it to the kids that's how terrible it was.,negative
"I really wanted to like these, but the taste is just bad and doesn’t freshen your breath.",negative

$13 for a tiny box though? Never again!,negative
"Delicious gum, the flavor lasts a good while too!",positive
"These are amazing! I love licorice, and these have a great flavor. I bought the company's Wintermints at a small shop while on vacation then decided to seek them online. I decided to try the licorice when I saw them, and they're great. At the time I bought them here, the Amazon image still showed evaporated cane juice as an ingredient, but the ones I bought in the shop were only molasses granules and essential oil. I contacted the company, and they said that the Amazon image needs updating. None of their pastilles have evaporated cane juice anymore.",positive
Es un té con un sabor y aroma delicioso.  Además viene sellado en paquetes de 2 por lo que se mantiene fresco y no pierde sus cualidades.,positive
"I've bought their mayo before, in jars, and it's amazing. As someone who's developed a sensitivity to soy as an adult, I was pretty disappointed to discover that it's in most mayonnaise--but not this one, thank goodness! I often add it to packaged tuna and was thrilled to see these packets that would be good to take hiking/camping. I knew I wouldn't be able to finish a pack of 60 in a reasonable timeframe, but I figured I'd have some time before they expired.Oh, sweet summer child.In fact, they arrived on July 9, but the ""best before"" date was April 10--three months earlier. I was able to reach out to Amazon for a return exception (grocery items are usually non-returnable) and received a refund, fortunately. I'm hesitant to reorder the item since I frankly don't trust Amazon to remove the expired stock from their warehouse. I just wish the manufacturer sold directly or sold the packets at Whole Foods or similar; I'd rather pay more for product that I can actually use than have to deal with the hassle of hoping whatever Amazon sends isn't expired.",negative
What a wonderful instant pancake mix. Everyone thought I made it from scratch. The Original mix has no eggs or milk products in it so my youngest Grandson could have as many pancake as he wanted without have an allergic reaction. Thank you Birch Benders.,positive
I buy this brand because of the claim that the product is not fortified.,positive
Love Love Love this!!!,positive
I sent this to my son away at grad school for finals week. It was just the right combination of healthy and not so healthy snacks. He was happy to have a little pick me up and it was great for sharing with his study group. I will defiantly send this again throughout the year. It was so easy to send to home straight from Amazon!,positive
Love Red Rose Tea..,positive
"One of my favorite hot sauces.  Found it at this sub chain called Firehouse Subs, and actually order it to put on my own sandwiches.  It is quite hot, but very flavorful. Not strongly vinegary, not strongly tomato-y, and not strongly peppery, just a nice balance with a great amount of kick.",positive
"Skittles, not much to say here. Exactly as advertised.",positive

Vegan. Delicious. Perfect. :)  Just what I was looking for!  I wish other companies would realize they don't need the other stuff to make it.,positive

It did not look like the capital letter I,negative
"I haven't used powdered milk before but my neighbor said she's used it for years in her coffee instead of liquid milk because her coffee remains hot.  Now I am hooked.  The fact that this milk is non-GMO and hormone free is another reason I choose this particular milk.  Lastly, if I run out of liquid milk or there is a shortage, I have shelf stable milk I can use at anytime.  I will buy this product again.",positive
This is not the candy I remember growing up.  Mr. Melon's (Melonheads) were green.  These are watermelon jelly beans.  Not a happy customer.,negative
"Just like the grocery store item, but lower price.",positive

A very top shelf coffee for a regular coffee price!  Made with 100% Arabic beans but with only selecting the top 10% of the beans.  There is no coffee better than Community,positive
"Great buy you won't regret It... used daily for almost every meal! Best stuff out there, nothing compares to flavorgod changed my whole perspective of what It means to season properly. You're missing out if you don't order you'll love it 100% garnuteed!",positive
"I just ate the whole package of 100% Vegetable Pasta, Fettuccine Alfredo. I am a diabetic and pasta is just too HIGH in carbs for a two oz. serving!!Who eats two ozs. of pasta ???I loved every bite. It was sooo much like pasta. Yes the serving size is small for the price and I will mix it with Italian Turkey Sausage next time it will stretch it. For some one like me, who can't have pasta very often, this is perfect. Thank You Birdseye, I will buy this product again and again.Also your Riced Cauliflower is WONDRFUL!! I miss pasta and rice very much, now I can have something so good tasting and good for meCan you do the same for ICE CREAM? :):)",positive

Good sea flavor and toasty overtone.,positive
"I bought this ""vanilla extract "". I have never been more disappointed in anything I have bought.  It smells like alcohol, it tastes like alcohol,  it is worthless!  Don't waste your money!  Buy it off the shelf of your local store.  That way you will get real vanilla extract!  I am now making my own extract.  Get lots of recipes off you tube. Again do not buy this brown water!",negative
great for sore throats and good too thx deb,positive
"I wanted to try these as they're such a low carb snack and I love chips. I wanted to like them, I really did, but it's gonna be a no for me dawg. They start off crunchy but they end up with a weird consistency, I guess ""protein-ie"" if you will. They're pretty salty too, kind of too salty, and the cheese flavor tastes like a typical cheeto knock-off. Wish I could return these lol",negative
"I did not like them, they are quite tasteless.",negative
Love to add this to my oatmeal!!,positive
There is no other soy sauce like LaChoy!!!,positive
I have purchased vanilla beans many times before. these are definitely not satisfactory quality and not what I expected for the price.,negative

Its a little pricey but it does make food taste good! It's has a little glass container that keeps the saffron fresh. I bought this item a while back and its still fresh.,positive
"I am not a big breakfast eater, but my daughter bought this jelly and it is the best we have ever tasted.  Hands down!  It only takes about a 1/4 to 1/2 a tsp on a slice of toast to have the flavor explode in your mouth.  It is fresh and delicious.  We can no longer find it in our local stores and it is now a must have in our house.  We were so glad to find it here on amazon.  If you are a raspberry lover this is definitely the jelly for you",positive
"This hot sauce has a great flavor profile, with the Grapefruit adding a subtle citrus note. The Habanero pepper flavor comes through with a nice amount of heat, but not so flaming hot as to be overpowering.A little bit goes a long way, and the dispenser bottle is well designed so that it is easy to get the right amount on your food without pouring out too much at a time.Looking forward to some other flavors, as this is the only flavor I've seen for this brand...",positive
These items are not equivalent to sell in a penny,negative
They’re so darn delicious,positive
Really good spice,positive
"When I received this in my order it was hard as a rock obviously not ripe. I understand that, but what I do not understand is why two days later it’s still hard and not ripe, but COVERED IN MOLD. I never had the chance to cut it open let alone eat it.",negative
It is delicious! Makes even cheap meat taste amazing! I've been looking for a steak seasoning and I have finally found it!!,positive
Has no flavor. I bought other Café Bustelo in grocery store that was great. Perhaps I ordered a different Café Bustelo. Plan to get an instant espresso to salvage the other 94 K-cups........,negative
"My mother uses this product all the time, she has to have it on the shelf. She was preparing a dish the other night and grabbed for her seasoning with the blue lid and found she was out of chicken, it was another flavor. She was heartbroken. She hurriedly came up with another way yo save the recipe while she beckoned me to order as quickly as possible, so this would not happen again.Also, when I cannot find it locally I can always find it here. This is my lifesaver if and when I need it.",positive
"I was super stoked to get these, as I was tired of buying packs of runts for just the bananas. So, I ordered these. Got them in the mail and opened the bag to eat them, and major disappointment. These are the most flavorless piece of candy I've ever had. They don't taste like banana, or much of anything. Unfortunately I can't return them, but how I wish I could!",negative
Tastes like meat !,positive

My kids love them; I love them! A simple grab & go snack! Delicious!,positive
Brake time!! Nothing for lunch. Tonite.,neutral
"I have purchased several different Manuka Honey brands here on Amazon, and can honestly say that STEENS 20 UMF is the absolute best I have tried so far, without question. The flavor is very smooth, not to sweet, with a warm pleasant, and slightly grainy texture. You can really taste the aromatic flavor from the Manuka Flower. Certainly unlike any local honey I have tried here in the US, or anywhere I might add, which really sets it apart. The price is very reasonable and fair for the high quality honey you receive. It’s very easy to see and taste the consistency and pride of exceptional bee keeping that has gone into every container I have purchased to date. I don’t normally write extensive in depth reviews, but the quality and hard work that goes into this amazing honey I have received certainly warrants it. Don’t just take my word for it, the taste and quality says it all.",positive
"The wonderful aroma wafts from you cup as you pour the boiling water over the teabag, so you know it will taste great. Every flavor is really nice at any temperature - I tried them hot, lukewarm, and over ice, and I loved it every time.",positive

"I have been away from drinking coffee (and other caffeine drinks) for about 10 years and just started drinking it again.  I had forgotten all the brands that I used to like so I have been experimenting with different brands trying to find one I really like.  I came across this variety pack on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  In my opinion, this coffee is one of the most flavorful coffees I have every consumed.  It is not as bitter, nor is it as strong as Peets or Starbucks, but it is MUCH more flavorful.  I especially like the Rain Forest Blend.  I would recommend this coffee for those who drink coffee for the flavor and not the extreme jolt of caffeine.  Oh yeah, the cups themselves are not made of plastic and are earth friendly, if that kink of thing is of concern to you.  Personally, I like these disposable cups.",positive
This syrup is totally awesome!!!!,positive
I order these often and I don’t know what changed but I have had 5 defective pods with this order. Very disappointed.,negative

"LOVE this tea!  I just returned from Ireland, and fell in love with this rich, full-bodied tea.  Now, I can relish the wonderful memories of being in the Emerald Isle whenever I drink this tea.",positive
"I have ordered this before around this time and it was shipped with a cooler pack or dry ice; however this was not the case. I froze it and broke it up into candy bar pieces. I guess when life hands you soup, freeze it. The seller has not responded back so I can't give it higher ratings. i would have liked some sort of care taken in a package, but it didn't happen this time. The flavor is good and mom was reasonably happy. The value was not there for me, because if I wanted a candy bar, I would have ordered that. The flavor is good, for milk chocolate and reconstituted well after being melt (which is not always the case). Presentation, well no care taken for shipping the package. Yes I know it is a pandemic and all, I know for next time.",negative
Great price for hella tajin. Lately I’ve been using this wonderful spice for all my fruits and I love it!,positive
Tastes great! When you first open it you have to pour out the excess liquid. I patted mine dry with a paper towel. It’s got great texture and flavor.,positive
"At first tasting from the can I thought it was too salty, so use I used it sparingly. I was wrong, I regretted not going full throttle. Next was spot on....deep rich flavor you want and crave in blacken your food. So far I have use it on steak, pork tenderloin and hamburger to rave reviews. I'm known to be a great home chef and this did not disappoint. Highly recommend for the true blacken flavor!",positive
The flavor is great but don’t understand why I only received I box.,positive
"When I stir fried in oil, it was just ok but when I stir fried in butter this stuff was off the charts good. Stir fry your meat and veggies first then add a little of this right before you plate it and you'll be hooked!",positive

My wife loooves this flavor of tea!,positive
I got hooked on this while traveling in the Luberon in France a couple of years ago.Have been ordering ever since.  Also love the Herbes de Provences Bio not available on Amazon.  WIsh they were!,positive

Product itself is great. Had a 50 lb bag that just ran out. The way the product was wrapped and sent was great. Upon opening the product i discovered that the bag was covered in some liquid. Upon inspection i found the source. Also the picture provided is not the package you will receive. Overall i like the chocolate but everything else was a let down.,negative
Great cheaper then store and fast shipping store is 5.99$ i paid about $3.75 each i bought 8 i shoild habe bought like 20 casesPeople posted they tasted bad or old or other bad reviews they were wrong they tast exactly like ones from stores i like the 16.9oz size its perfect for drinking and carrying will order more if they give a good price again or wish they had subscription order,positive
"Sorry to say, this tea doe NOT work for me!  I'm used to drinking Organic India Tulsi Tea, but when I switched to this brand to save money, it has given me severe arrhythmia, pressure headache, anxiety, and high BP and HR.  Even diluting it 90%, it still causes me severe symptoms! I have been able to tolerate 10 mg caffeine in Green Coffee Bean Extract, so this really mystifies me as to why I am getting such a severe reaction to this tea. Have to send it back.",negative
"Oh this is delicious stuff--there are a lot of claims about the healing qualities of Manuka Honey. I guess I believe them but now that I have it, I will never use another honey.  The UMF is quite important, this is 15+, making it a very high quality.  My husband went to NZ recently and brought me back another jar, UMF 20 which is the highest certification.  Even though it is made in NZ, it is extremely expensive there--this 15+ is an exceptionally good value and a quality product.",positive
too much cinnamon and other spices,negative

Very pleasant transaction. My item arrived way earlier than I thought it would since it was coming from out of the country.

it had maybe 10 cherries!!!  Not worth 1.00,negative
The first Light Mayo that I prefer over regular mayonnaise. Made with cage-free eggs!,positive
The chocolate is not worth almost $7 a bar. The hazelnuts are not whole as stated and there is a layer of some kind of hazelnut filling on top of the chocolate which is not in the description. The chocolate is not dark either but more milk chocolate.  I gave them all to my son who like Hersheys.,negative
I like this blend of black tea and oil of bergamot. It has exceptional flavor even after adding a touch of milk. Can anyone comment as to why the sealed box does not contain an expiration date?,positive

THIS IS GREAT, THANKS!",positive
"Received candy in one day...Inside the box was a melted, oozing mess.  Could not remove the individual bat wrappers because the candy was so soft and gooey, the wrappers stuck to the candy.  Refridgerating the candy did little to help.  Really feel my money was wasted on this one.",negative
"The decal was perfect for a 8in or 9inch cake. It left me enough room to add the decorations around the edge. Don't mind the messed up gel frosting...lol.

I left the cake with decal in fridge over night and it didn't mess up or run.",positive

I just can't live without it.  Important part of my day.  1oz or shot every morning.,positive
"We have used this rub on a variety of meats, even mixed with seasoning for vegetables.  We believe in expanding our taste buds and uses of different spices and seasonings.  This has a nice smoky flavor but nothing overwhelming or bitter.  However, it still does need some salt to it, but otherwise, it is a bright flavor.  And not much is needed depending on your desire for a bold/bolder flavor.The magnetic tin is a great convenience to have.  And we will likely clean it and use it for something else once we are done with the seasoning.",positive

these are a great change of pace from regular chips. and they are gluten free for those needing that.delicious.,positive
"Buying the Locatelli in a chunk like this is such a great value, especially if you buy the containers of the grated at the stores.  It tastes better when you grate it fresh and based on the price I pay for an 8 Oz container at the store, I was able to get almost twice the amount for what I pay at the store.  I love to slice it thin and squeeze a little fresh lemon juice on it and enjoy with a glass of buttery Chardonnay or even a dry Cabernet",positive

Took too long for delivery and by the time I received them... which was after the date I was given for my delivery twice... they were oily and did not look appetizing.,negative
"I love these soups! They always make my nose run from the spiciness, but that's part of the appeal to me. There are also usually a few mushrooms which I like. You can make the soup with boiling water or in the microwave.",positive
Omg! I found a new fave. I love these<3,positive
"These kernels (seeds) taste really good. I have never heard of them, but was interested in the possible health benefits. I was a little unsure though because they said “bitter” so I was thinking they would not taste good. These seeds taste great! I could sit down and eat them like peanuts or cashews they taste that good (But the package says no more than 3 per day)! They are small, as you can see from the picture of them next to a USA quarter. Now hopefully I will see a health benefit in a number of months.",positive
"I love this stuff, and make sure to buy it every year before fresh tomatoes are in season.  Wonderful with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil.",positive
"They were exactly what I expected, sweet tangy and tart like sweet tarts should be great 10 ounce size and good packaging from Amazon definitely would recommend for those who love sweet tarts",positive
Really yummy - my kids and husband love them. Perfect for snacks for school.,positive
I can get addicted to this. Yes it's good!,positive
I use shallots for many sauces and dishes. Excellent quality!,positive
I loved everything about it...not too sweet...adult delicious sweet! A tiny bit pricey but worth it.,positive
"I normally get my organic raspberry leaf tea on amazon's subscribe & save for about $12 a pound from Frontier (link:  but it has been out of stock. I decided to try this tea & while it is a lot more expensive, it is very good. I have Endometriosis & find the tea to be beneficial along with a combination of a AIP & Low FODMAPs diet. I think raspberry tea tastes best hot with a little organic maple sugar & organic SO Delicious vanilla coconut milk creamer. As an iced tea, it has a dry mouthfeel (odd I know) & I don't care for the taste as much. It is better if other organic herbals are added like rose hips, hibiscus, rooibos, orange peel, etc. for a slightly tart vit. C rich iced summer beverage.Overall, aside from the price, I think this product is great.",positive
These little guys taste like Sen Sen. remember that from the 60s. And these great people from Finland ship it to you. The drops are in a nice little box and handy to pop one in your mouth. Not everyone loves salty black licorice. But I do!,positive
This stuff is GREAT! Flavor is delicious and texture is nice and crunchy.,positive
The very best chili powder in the world.  I've used it for over 75 years. Nothing compares with it.,positive
This brand was much cheaper then others. Kernels pop up smaller very few unpopped kernels. The flavor is better then the higher priced. We like the big kernels but flovor makes up for the small size,positive
Habit forming. Love them . Great value. Taste really good. Have given as gifts. Makes me popular.,positive
"Not sure if we got a bad batch or a stale batch, but this was not quality jerky.Being on a specific diet, and having to eat a lot of jerky on this diet, I've had plenty of good jerky... This fell well short of being decent, let alone worth buying.",negative
The most amazing fig spread available. It's fantastic with cheese.,positive
"I ordered a 1 lb bag of Lemon flavored Snowflake Xylitol candy.  It came and did not have much flavor.  I was disappointed!  I wrote a bad review.  The customer service person, Kenny, (thanks Kenny!) refunded my money right away and also helped me to navigate thru the Snowflake website that allows me to order through Amazon on the Snowflake website.  The other flavors that I tasted, apple, watermelon, strawberry, and blue raspberry, were so good.  I was using Ice Chips, but I have now switched over to Snowflake Candy.  This can happen to anybody.  Maybe the product wasn't fresh from Amazon, who knows, but I am happy with the other flavors and will re-order with Snowflake Candy.",positive
"I received this for Christmas from a friend.  The jar was large for a spice mix first time I have consumed a product like this.  It is excellent when cooking shellfish, chicken, pork, steaks, potatoes - well everything.  One of the best products I've ever received and used.",positive
"Like you said, it is different from the cinnamon most of us are used to. Until I read about cinnamon just last week, I never knew the' store- bought'cinnamon had high levels of 'coumarin', which can be toxic to your liver, when consumed regularly. I have been taking cinnamon for my health, sowanted the best and Ceylon cinnamon has the least amount of 'coumarin'. Thank you Organic Wise for your excellent cinnamon.",positive
The new formula isn't as good as the old formula. But I still love it. Wish it was cheaper though.,positive
Love adding this to my yogurt or protein shakes.  Just the right amount of texture.,positive
"First off the packaging on this was awesome. I didn't want to open it because of that. But hey it's chocolate so I had to. Once open I discovered bite size chocolate with bits of pistachios inside. Delicious, flavor. I decided to hide them from my husband but he found them. I would definitely recommend and I dare you to eat just one.",positive
Exactly what I ordered. Very fresh.,positive
good but a bit on the pricey side,positive
"The coffee is as good as any blue mountain I've tasted, and better than any other blue-mountain  k-cup out there(I've tried them all).  I also like that it is more environmentally friendly than regular k-cups.  I buy this regularly.  I had an issue with a few boxes -- and the company was back to me within hours. (The issue has been retooled -- I think I got a run where there was additional coffee in the pods, and my brewer didn't like it.)my only concern -- it's not available right now!  What am I going to do for my Christmas coffee?",positive
"Love this snack, it is pleasant tasting with plenty of peanuts and not hard and crunchy like some peanut brittle. I previously bought it at convenience/service station stores but have not been able to find it locally anymore and was glad it is available through Amazon. Who would have thought?",positive
"I accidentally  ordered the dark chocolate, I  normally order the milk choclate and they are amazing! These were melted when they arrived at my house and the dark choclate was not good.",negative
"This chocolate is seriously delicious. There are 26 pieces of chocolate that are 0.6 oz each and I've had to work really hard to not eat them all within the first week. You can find most of this chocolate at Target or CVS in the larger form (milk chocolate, marzipan, cornflake, and biscuit), but it was nice to get the sampler pack. My complaint is that the gift box is really disappointing because it's too big for the amount of chocolate. Luckily, this gift was for me so it wasn't a big deal",positive
Wow what a flavorful product,positive
Great coffee. Tastes fresh and lasts.,positive
I love Bakin Miracle.  I use it on all kinds of meat.  It adds flavor and keeps it moist.,positive
There is zero quinine flavor. It's like drinking fizzy water and expensive to boot,negative

Hard to find in my area. Was glad to surprise a peppermint loving friend with a treat from M&M in Christmas!!,positive
I am a daily tea drinker and have tried many brands. My preference are fruit teas and blueberry teas are usually at the top of my list.  This tea has a good taste and has become one of my favorites.,positive

This is very tasty and it being ready for the Keurig makes it so convenient.  Tea is hot and available throughout the day.  I will keepordering this.  Very good product and I recommend it to all you green tea lovers.,positive
"It has been a few years since I've used the Wilton gel icing colors, but I remembered liking them and I wanted a set with a big variety of colors for my daughter's art themed birthday party.  We decided to try letting the kids (ages 7-10) color their own small bowl of icing and decorate their own cupcakes.  With the gel colors, this worked out better than I imagined.  We had each child pick one of the colors from the set, we then dipped a toothpick in it and put that into a their individual icing, letting them stir it in.  The kids were thrilled with the colors they were getting.  Any that wanted more color added, we would just repeat with a brand new toothpick.  They had a great time creating their own unique cupcake.This set has a wide variety of colors, which is something I really like (I'm never good at getting the liquid ones to get the hue I want).  The gels are so easy to use too.  They are small containers, but a little goes a long way.  I have never done it, but I like how the package says that if they dry out, you can use some Wilton Glycerin to restore it.  That will make it nice to keep these, since I'm not big on baking but will occasionally get the bug and like to be prepared to do what I want.  I'm happy having these in my pantry again.",positive
I love this candy and that it is sugar free is a plus.,positive
"Love, love, love. The flavor is gentle and I use it a salad dressing.",positive
"I love this coffee...luv the roast, the natural sweetness no need to add anything to it. I put in some hot water and run it through my magic bullet which gives it a nice frothy top. Delicious!",positive
I love this tea! I drink 2 cups every morning and love it. I gave up coffee to drink this 😂,positive
LOve it and use it all the time,positive
there was a big hole in the bag and there was coffee all over the bottom of the box,negative
a touch overpriced even when discounted,positive

Just the right amount for my 8 oz popper. Very good.,positive
Yum!  Pudding shots turned out great!,positive
"I had surgery which requires me to eat high protein.  I usually buy this at my local store, but lately they run out before I get there.  Buying it from Amazon got me through the holidays and it was fresh and wonderful and I will for sure purchase again!",positive
This is the best coffee we have ever had - made for the keurig brewers. The flavor is very full bodied with NO bitterness.,positive
The Jolly ranchers were  just what I wanted.  I put them in little gift bags for my coworkers.  They loved them. The 2lb bag will last a  good while. The price was just right.,positive
"Wowowow we love this stuff. We’re a garlic loving family, but we do not go in for fakey garlic flavor or anything over the top. This is absolutely perfect. Just enough garlic flavor that you can make most dishes tastier with a simple drizzle. We are repurchasing!",positive
The island of Hawaii produces some of the best coffee in the world in Kona. I have visited the coffee farms and many are small . This industry helps the local economy. It was so convenient to purchase this great coffee through Amazon and to get a 1 pound bag! Hooray!,positive
Absolutely ridiculous! This is a tiny bag of candy for $25! And I can’t return it because it’s food. Do not buy!,negative
I received the McCormick Gourmet free to test. I used the product while making baked Salmon. I have used many other brands and never really could taste what the spice actually brought to the dish. It was very mild. McCormick was very different ans not only could I smell the spice i could taste it after being baked and even adding lemon and butter to the dish.,positive
"This is the best tasting organic dark chocolate, that has the most excellent notes of orange.  I have tried other organic dark chocolate brands from Trader Joe's and Whole Foods that have the same ""flavoring"", but NONE of the other brands have been able to capture the smoothness and fullness of  Green & Black's Maya Gold.  I also enjoy Hazelnut & Curant, and the Mint flavors of  Green & Black's, but Maya  Gold is by far the best tasting to me.",positive
"Here's my cadence: get off work, drive the 50 minutes home, on the way have one of these and preworkout, ready to kill it when I get home. These are SO good and a staple in my pantry.",positive
Unbelievable. The bag is the size of my hand. I think I paid $17 for this.,negative
"All of the above was very good, but the service...... the absolute worst ever!!!!I.  I ordered 16 of the Maxwell House International Foods Original Cappuccino. To date I have received  8 of Cinnamon Dullce, 8 of the Mocha, 8 of the Orange Latte, and 4 only of the Original Cappuccino  which I ordered. Truly am wondering why you can’t  get this order right. It really is not that difficult.Although I do not care for the mocha flavor  or the Orange Latte, I gave it to some friends who were quite pleased with them",positive
"I wish the container wasn't soo broken, it would have been the perfect gift but no, i send her this and her text said, i love chocolate but the box is broken,",negative
I use Queen Liz's seasoning often and in almost everything from burgers to casseroles.,positive
"This is basically ginger flavored candy.  It is a sort of soft gummy coated in sugar.  Lots of sugar.  It bears no resemblance to actual crystalised ginger.  If you're looking for ginger candy this is your product.  However, if you are looking for crystalised ginger, give it a pass.",negative
"Using this powder alters the recipe preventing the butter to be able to ""brown""",negative
Just a great basic tea. Great hot or ices and good base for mixing in other blends.,positive
These were the perfect cupcake toppers for my son’s graduation party! Loved them!!,positive
Use in drinks and cooking. Works great.,positive
"I want to order more because it's not in my local store. The price is fair and the taste is awesome. Depending on how thick you prefer your pancakes, I actually prefer them near crepe thin.But generally the directions are: Just add equal parts mix &  water or milk (plant based or other) stir well and pour on a oiled or nonstick well heated pan. You'll love them.",positive
"DELIVERED IN TIME. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TESTED LIKE WAHT I DRAKE IN CHINA, BUT IT'S NOT. STILL, IT TESTS BEETER THAN GROUND COFFEE I BREW EVERYDAY~",positive

These are not K-Cup brand.  They do not work in the Keurig 2.0.,negative
Needed this for a recipe. Arrived in 2 days.,positive
"I’m not big on the flavor, not a big tea fan. But it really works well when you have a bellyache, or stomach cramps. Also works well to reduce inflammation and settle down diarrhea. I keep this in stock at all times. Usually I will add a little honey because of the flavor. It does have the typical ginger spiciness to it.",positive
I love this rice. Great brand.,positive
"This works great for my (in home) caramel macchiato that I make. My use of these flavored sauce for espresso, it lasts a long time.",positive
Sooooo delicious and packed with flavor.  Only need one or two per drink.  Yummy!,positive
My least favorite sardines. Thankfully only 21 tins left.,negative

Prompt shipping & great price! Thank you,positive
These do NOT taste good.  I will have to be pretty desperate to finish this pack.  Yuck.,negative
"My niece absolutely loved making these! It was a super fun project, we had to look up YouTube videos for directions, but everything turned out great. She ate almost all of the candies we made (some are sour and she didn't like them). Theyre super cute and come with everything necessary to make them.",positive
So stale such a waste of money I’m so disappointed,negative

I bought this to use as the cake topper for my wedding cake. It arrived damaged and I am very sad to see that I cannot request a replacement.,negative
"I actually ordered these by accident .  I was looking for another raspberry product ( with chocolate) made by this company.  When I received them, I was shocked as they were different and much bigger than I expected.  That said - these are better and much less fattening than the others .  I have given quite a few bars away, and even if people initially say they don’t eat many sweets, they admit that these are a really tasty treat !  Most ‘pink’ candies are strawberry but the raspberry is a pleasant ( and better, IMHO) surprise !",positive
Rich and buttery taste.  Just right when you want something special!!,positive
"BE CAREFUL!! This is a very, very hot sauce. I eat tons of hot food and own a small collection of these uber hot sauces. And I can confidently say that this is the hottest stuff I've ever owned, by far. For comparison, I can eat 4-5 habaneros straight up in a bowl of noodles with no ill effects other than the typical burning butt the next day.  True story: While at work, I nearly died hours after eating a few doses of this sauce. By doses, I mean I was dipping beef jerky strips into the neck of the bottle and coating the first inch+ of each strip. I may have eaten about 8 of these strips over the course of the day. Then in the evening I felt a severe burning sensation in my stomach, or maybe it was my intestines. I immediately went to the restroom and tried to relieve myself of this pain. It only got worse. I had the most severe cold sweats I've ever had in my life. Like a horrible fever, but with goosebumps. Then I had a hard time taking breaths! I had to command my body to breathe! My insides were in too much pain to involuntarily breathe. I had to rest my head on the handicap bar in the stall (eww, I know). Necessary because I began to slip in and out of consciousness and I had to make sure I didn't just collapse onto the floor.  This process would ebb and then recur again a few times during the evening. I called my Wife and kids in case I didn't make it. Just so they would know that I was a moron and killed myself eating hot sauce. I caught a decent break from the symptoms for about an hour, so I decided to drive home. I live a half hour away from the office, but it's a very easy drive so I chanced it. Minor versions of what happened above occurred twice while I was going home, but it was relatively manageable... Until I got about a mile away from home and then the real stuff came back with a vengeance!  It was pretty late in the evening by now, so luckily there were no cars on the road. Good because the pains roared back, and I started to have trouble breathing again. I had to roll all of the windows down and stick my head outside like a dog just so I could suck in some air. By the time I parked I was hurting bad and gasping for air. I went to the door and my Wife and kids opened it up. I stumbled in and up the stairs on all fours. My kids were laughing at me saying that I was acting like a gorilla. They say the craziest things don't they?  After that spell subsided, I tried to lay on the couch and watch some TV to take my mind off of the pain. But then it hit me once again. My Wife was watching all of this BTW. I fell off of the couch and all I could do was squirm on the floor in agony. I started to realize something. My arms and legs were moving completely on their own. I watched my right arm just swing in random directions and it was kinda funny. Like watching myself on video. I see myself but I can't control myself. The funniest part of the night was when my Wife, while watching all of this, said ""why do you do this to yourself?"" So I promised her, never again :)",positive
I bought this because you get much more for the price compared to leading brands. I was spending the same for about a third of the kernels. I cannot not tell the difference in taste or cooking time. I would highly recommend this brand for its value and flavor!,positive
Besides it being GREAT coffee and that I can put it on a repeat order I have to say my keurig coffee maker lovesit too. Since switching to San Francisco Bay coffee we have not had any clogging issues with the keurig while we were constantly having issues with K cups. Awesome flavor and awesome design!,positive
"The cider tastes fine. The problem is the ""duds"". At lease SIX in my last box of 24 produced nothing but hot water. Do these guys have a problem with quality control?",negative

I was so happy to find Enstroms candy here.  I Love this and it is handy to have smaller pieces.  I will definitely buy this again!,positive
Kudos on rebranding 90% peanuts as a healthy nut option by including maybe 10% of a mix of healthier nuts and leaving all the messy skins on all the nuts. Shameful trickery. Save your money!!,negative
Incredibly clean and delicious!!,positive
Disappointed. They don’t taste good at all. In fact mine had a bitterness to them and tasted like they were rolled in Splenda.,negative
Good flavor! Better price. Very popular with my girlfriends!,positive

This is my go to brand for cacao butter… to make raw chocolate and body butter. Soooo good.,positive
"I learned about this spice from Alton Brown, and will be forever grateful to him. I call it ""backpepper"" as opposed to black pepper; it has a forward fruitiness but the pungency is almost entirely in the aftertaste, which lingers long and carries food flavors along with it. Its highest and best use is in soups and on rare steak; I grind it over the meat VERY heavily an hour or so before cooking (for sous vide, I use somewhat less). Great stuff.",positive
We had a socially distant driveway neighborhood party and these were perfect to put out as snacks. I was impressed with the portion size in the variety of options. all were fresh!,positive

This was bought as a gift and the recipients loved it!,positive
"I have always liked peanut butter. But, I tried this years back and now will only eat this peanut butter. I used to buy it in the stores in Texas, but I can’t find it in the stores in WA. Thank goodness Amazon has it! You will love the flavor and the ease of spreading it. I promise this is the best tasting peanut butter out there!",positive
I used this to give my home made hot sauce some extra body and to keep it from separating in the fridge and it worked perfectly. 2+ weeks no separation and a great thicker sauce. Cannot recommend this product enough.,positive
"I simple love this sweet chilli sauce; I could put it on most every type of meat, chicken, pork, or fish!  However, my favorite use is to dip or cover chicken wings in this sauce-wow-you can't go wrong!",positive
"I never loose in purchasing this gum and it is impossible to find in any store in the DC metro area.  It is refreshing and freshens my breath.  I use it to help minimize hunger pains, when I am tired of driving and need a pick-me-up, and when I want something sweet and don't want to ruin my diet with a dessert.",positive
"Good, I used for cooking rice & Beans",positive
Tried freeze dried coffee as an alternative to keurig cups. Tastes better at lower price per cup,positive
"I first seen this product on the TV show ""  SHARK TANK""  it sounded so good I had to buy it. Taste: Yuck! Very runny taste nothing like it sounds. Wish I would have read the reviews before buying it. I didn't even want to give it one star. Very disappointed.....that's 18 bucks in the trash.",negative
Easy to fix.  I often add  veggies for variety,positive

"Saw Hot Ones, got this for my brother who saw it with me and loves spicy food. I will go into detail what it was like putting a single drop on my plate and then licking that off:Stage 1: Huh StageI lick it off, instantly it's a bit of a bang and a mouth sizzle as it infects your taste buds, almost sitting there as you say ""it's not so bad"" and then BOOMStage 2: OOF StageYour mouth contorts, you gag forward, you cough and it travels its Scorched Earth Policy down your throat and into your soul. Closing your eyes it sears into your mouth, raising your mouth to a spiciness temperature you haven't had in a long, long time, bringing back that memory of when you were 6 and trying out spicy peppers in the backyard.Stage 3: Tears StageCoughing more and more, you guzzle milk and shove down cake in the hopes of absorbing some of the spice but to no avail. It is part of you now. I had tears in my eyes, but nay I did not shed them. I glared at the camera as my father filmed me. My brother, meanwhile, said it really wasn't that bad.Stage 4: Post BellumEven an hour after the whole affair, I still taste it in my mouth, saturating the cells and spit there like Chernobyl's radiation in northern Ukraine's soil. Not something to eat on a regular basis. Consume at your own risk.",positive
Cookies were wrapped in bubble very well packaged I was able to use cookies in goodie bags and on sweets table super cute kids loved them and so did adults,positive

I love earl grey tea and decided to try lady grey just to see what the difference was and feel in love.  My sister did too.  It's slightly lighter but more fragrant.  Very nice for any time of day.,positive
All other flavors are amazing. This one tastes like all the cinnamon in the world was dumped into it. Toooooo much. And I love cinnamon. Kind of tastes like how those cinnamon brooms at the grocery store smell during holiday time. No good and expensive so get a diff flavor.,negative
Too many salty choices and too few sweet choices.,negative
"Wish it was slightly cheaper, because I'm addicted",positive
um..white chocolate...just yum!,positive
I was so pleased with this item.  Just as described.,positive
Excellent Sugar Additive instead of using white sugar,positive

"Perfect tea with just the right sweetness if you like only lightly sweetened tea. Usually bottled tea is way to sweat, but this brand is perfect if you don't like that artificial sugar taste.",positive
"Use it for a sweetener, great honey for a great price.",positive
Cookies are delicious but they arrived crushed and broken.,negative
"I love seaweed snacks, but was a little hesitant because of the sweetness of the tapioca on these.  However, after trying it, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet by any stretch.  I think I still prefer the wasabi, but that's just personal taste.",positive

"Put this in my Peanut butter because to balance the Omega 3 and 6 ..... PB has too much Omega 6, which is inflammatory, so it needs Omega 3 to balance it out... You could buy Smart Balance peanut butter or just put Flax oil in your peanut butter",positive
"I love the delicious taste of Super Greens and use it on a regular basis to insure I get enough servings of fruit and veggies. I am also thrilled with the quality of the product. It is non-GMO, 100% Vegan, gluten-free and the majority of the ingredients are organic. I have tried other products that cost more and didn't taste nearly as good, so I am very comfortable recommending this product.",positive
"I love Japanese culture and I LOVE Green Tea. I used to drink it 30 years ago at the Japanese Embassy, so finding a good brand that has exactly the right taste is a great thing.Good quality and great versatility. You can actually do anything you want with this magic green powder. This is not only good for making green tea to drink, but it could also be used in a variety of different recipes: smoothies, baked goodies (cakes, cookies), but also ice cream and many other cold dishes. There are lots of different ideas if you look online.I am very happy with this tea, and even if it is a small bag, it lasts for a good time. The only thing I would ""complain"" about is that it is quite expensive to be that small. $16.99  for 3.5oz is definitely not cheap. I wish it could be just a little less expensive, then I would for sure buy more.But overall GREAT PRODUCT. Definitely recommended.",positive
I really enjoy and love this gum and how long lasting it is. Just remember blowing bubbles probably isn't always the best. Mostly my advice comes that if you get it on the outside of your lips it's good it's gonna stick like sap. Make sure you notice the paper it comes with is to save it from sticking to your fingers.,positive
Arrived squished box messed up but product is ok not worth returning,positive
"I use cumin in many of my recipes, so I go through a lot of it!  Its nice to find a quality brand for a good price.  I will definitely be buying again!",positive
Not cost effective ...do not purchase ...costco carries 2 of the 3 liters for very reasonable price,negative
"I love, love, LOVE this lemon oil for baking and cake frostings. It gives your baked goods an intense, true lemon flavor.Some Amazon reviewers have had problems getting a measure amount of this lemon oil from the bottle without making a mess or winding up pouring too much. Here is the solution: Buy yourself a glass eye dropper to extract just the right amount you need... no more mess or wasted lemon oil !",positive
Changed the product and disappointed in the changes.,negative
This is a little pricey (as are all organic foods) but it is the best tasting sauce I've had.  I love that it's low sodium!,positive
Showed up new in the boxes as expected.,positive
"The color was a vibrant green rather than a dull green like some cheaper alternatives, the flavor was smooth and goes perfectly well with some milk and stevia which is how I drink it. As all matcha you have to continuously stir. Small size good for those who only drink matcha on occasion.",positive

Product is good and will work for what I need it for.,positive
I love these creamers. They are delicious and portable.,positive
"The summer heat affected the quality of the product. It was also very small for the price. Not a fair deal. I took one bite and it was really something that I did not want to eat. I threw the rest of it into the trash. So, maybe order it during cold weather. Still, it is overpriced for what you’re getting for your money.",negative
Since being on a low sodium diet for my heart this product has been a game changer. It adds so much flavor to anything that I previously used salt on.  Nothing can replace salt but this sure is close!!  I take it everywhere I go to eat.,positive

Not only is it delicious, but noticed my heart burn isnt nearly as bad as it used to be since I discovered Poppi. They are pricy but totally worth it when you’re wanting something sweet /flavorful without the calories.",positive

"I love these bars!  Two to a pack are just the right amount and they fill you up.  Plus, they are good for you!  They do crumble pretty easliy, but I don't mind that at all.  I just remedy that by using a papertowel or plate.  Yum yum!!!!!  I highly recommend these.",positive
My son has a nut allergy and we are always looking for alternatives that are equally delicious and make the other kids want them just as well. Skeeter has succeeded!

"I was so impressed with this lavender! It has a deep color and the fragrance was outstanding. This is the best product of this type I have bought in quite some time. Not only does the lavender deserve 5 glowing stars the company does as well. I contacted the seller with a question about the product. The representative contacted me within a few hours. The question was answered promptly and the representative was great. I have used the product to make a number of things. The quality of the product is exceptional. It made wonderfully fragrant sachets and bath teas. I made small gift bags for health care workers and the response was overwhelming. I will definitely be recommending this company and purchasing more of their products. Great company, great product!!",positive
"Great oat fiber, huge bag.  I use it to add fiber to my baked goods. Be careful not to use too much when baking or it will affect the texture of your goods.",positive

Love these vinegar and salt almonds! This size is never available in the supermarket. Good price!,positive
I have had to cut my sodium intake and while I didn't care for potassium chloride and its tinny flavor this is a great substitute. There is still sodium in it but the level is a lot lower than regular salt.,positive

"Excellent quality, on second bag Great customer service, fast deliveryWill all ways purchase this brand, don't change a thing",positive
"Tastes the same as what I used to have when I was a kid. Each one is individually wrapped so the quality is very consistent. I agree that the sour part is short-lived -- I am actually glad that's how it is -- otherwise it becomes quite hard to bear, haha! Glad that I can find this on amazon. Thank you!",positive
"The thickest, best hot chocolate ever!",positive
"This is one of the best coffees from Peets, delivered on time and as described.",positive
"I bought this item for my caffeine addict mom, and she did not end up liking the taste. She gave me a cup to try and I feel the same way. I drank the full cup, then went to bed just fine around half an hour later. Maybe another product will at least have enough caffeine to affect me.",negative
We have tried a lot of protein bars and these far and away our favorite. The ingredient list is high quality and the taste is delicious.,positive

"Though the movie may have been ""true"" to Lewis's book (in that the script was basically word-for-word, verbatim), it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this. The mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) are *drawn* in, and as in the previous review, the green-screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow. I nearly laughed to death when I saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth; I nearly cried when I heard the wolf's ""howl--"" a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could.All of the acting is tremendously forced, especially that of little Lucy Penvensie... I could only take so much indignation, desperation, and buck teeth in the (what felt like) fourteen hours of watching the movie. The actress who plays the White Witch, in all her histrionics, seems that she'd be more at home on stage, where a booming voice, spread arms, and a valiant effort at something Shakespearian would be more than welcome. The sets feel claustrophobic, whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors. Indoors, it's as if BBC could only afford to spend $100 on constructing a set, and so it is very small, and all the characters are constantly huddled together. The White Witch's castle is a run-down, rotting countryside English castle filled with Styrofoam statues and bad lighting. When the Penvensie children are wandering through the woods-- actually, *any* scene in the woods-- feels like they are simply wandering around in circles. The only thing that looks decent in the film is Aslan, but you can bet that BBC probably blew the film's entire budget on building the mechanical feline. It looks great when it's standing still and before it starts speaking, but once it starts moving, you can't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear-end in the lion suit. Yes, if you are a hardcore Narnia fan, you may want to see this version, simply because it preserves every word that Lewis ever wrote-- but Lewis was certainly no screenwriter, and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen. During the scene in which the children are at the Beavers' and getting ready to flee from the wolves, Mrs. Beaver's incessant, ""oh, just ONE more thing, dearies, and then we will be ready to go,"" punctuated by the children's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of ""NO, Mrs. Beaver, PLEASE!"" -- a scene of comic relief, so incongruous (they are supposed to be FLEEING from imminent danger, not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not), detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have. In fact, the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these. I would recommend seeing the new Narnia (Disney 2005). The new movie, with updated effects, spectacular computer animation, great timing all around, and a gorgeous and scene- stealing White Witch (who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician, as opposed to a shrieking banshee) captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of Narnia without detracting the least bit from Lewis's original vision (I think). Lucy is a lot cuter (NO buck teeth, YAY!), as are the beavers (and realistically-sized), and bratty BBC Edmund has nothing on the divine, Desperately-Hungry-for-Acceptance-Insecure-and- Angsting-with-an-Inferiority-Complex Edmund that the new Disney version fronts. Unless you're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies, I would not recommend this film to anyone.",negative

I have been purchasing premium blue cheese stuffed olives of different brands lately and none of them taste “real”. There just is no fresh olive and blue cheese flavors anymore. It’s radically different than making your own. So I really can not recommend these or any others. Either do it yourself or just use putted olives that are not in a jar or can - so much better!,negative
Sugar FreeGreat tasteSmooth and tastyThis is the one if you’re looking for thirst quenching flavor,positive
The taste is great especially if you toast and add to veggies!  Better than salt!,positive
"These (Chicken Chili Verde flavor) were very tasty - a bit of spice, might be too much if you prefer mild. It wasn’t too spicy for me, and I don’t like a lot of heat. We pan grilled. I could see slicing these and making a southwestern sheet pan or skillet dinner with cubed potatoes, slice red onions, yellow peppers, maybe zucchini for color, sprinkled with cumin and oregano.My only con is that, typical of most sausages, these are salty. Not over the top, but if you’re sensitive to salty foods, check the package.",positive
"I'm a huge cheese straw lover and each flavor was great. The garlic was not overpowering, but I honestly think the Cajun ones tasted more like Italian/pizza than Cajun. (Probably due to the large amounts of herbs that are generally used in Italian cooking.",positive

There is brown sticky stuff on almost all of the individual creamer cups. I am having to soak and rub it off of probably 300 or more individual cups. It don’t seem to have changed the flavor of the creamer but it is gross to see and touch.,negative

"I have these as a noodle replacement and, surprisingly, they worked out great! Do not expect flavor from these noodles, they take on the flavor of whatever it is you cook with them... There is no flavor of their own. However, they are filling and a satisfying replacement. I've already re-bought and will do so again!",positive
I wish it had a lot more spice to it.,negative
"We love this in our home. It doesn’t have that yuk taste like most  low cal sweeteners. It tastes just like regular sugar and there’s no aftertastes. You can cook with it , dip strawberries right in it, anything you use regular sugar for you.can use this. I love it.",positive

"This oil is EXPENSIVE! but so worth it.  I snagged some while I was in New Orleans last year in May and just tried it recently.  I used to to make some of my protein cookies as well as make my own Balsamic Dressing and it was Awesome.  It taste great in anything you use it on, especially fish.  Oh how I LOVE THIS OIL.  I love anything pecan so this is a win win.  DID I SAY HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS OIL.Funny is I watched a video on how this is made, it's not even made in Louisiana its just bottled there.  The pecans come from Texas and they are shipped to California to have the oil made and then its bottled in Louisiana.Just get it, you won't be disappointed.",positive
This was a good way for me to taste a the different flavors of these Sahale snacks.  They are just the right portion for grab and go snacks or packed lunches.  These snacks are expensive at the stores so I thought this was a pretty good deal.,positive
Expensive but you won't get better flavor in your baking!,positive
This is a great spice trio. We have used it on fish and chicken. They are not too strong and give a nice taste to your good. We are trying it on everything! My husband who doesn’t always like spices loves them all .,positive
Best Kurig Coffee ever... PERIOD !,positive
I absolutely love this product it is so delicious truly refreshing and it does not have a lot of sugar very light especially ice cold the cutest little bottles I just adore which can be you used again if you like just because they're so adorable it's worth the price no more difference than you going to these different retail stores to have a refreshing drink which has a lot of sugar but this is really a delight I love this drink including my nurse loves to drink we drink it almost every other day I would drink it everyday if I could love it I recommend this drink,positive

I lost 9 lbs in two weeks with no exercise. I ate Miracle Noodles for lunch and dinner about 4 times a week. The Angel Hair is my favorite. The rice and linguine are okay.,positive
"This product is on a constant reorder.  This is an easy mix product which has a good consistency and tastes great.  Through experimenting with the ingredients, I've added an extra tablespoon of vegetable oil which seems to keep it moist and soft.

"Of all the tea's I have experimented with this is my absolute favorite! In an attempt to cut down on some of my caffine consumption I began trying different herbal tea's and fell in love with Rooibo's which I now drink everday instead of good old lipton's.Pride of Africa is a combination of rooibo's and honeybush tea, it is not only good for you it's tastes wonderful hot or cold. My only complaint would be that it is a bit expensive for me so Davidson's Rooibo's will be my basic tea but this will be around too and always purchased if it goes on sale!",positive

The bags arrived looking different from the photo in the listing.  I've purchased Reed's before and always loved it; NOT SO this time.  My big complaint is that not all of the crystalized ginger is edible.  There is a lot of inedible fiber that I end up spitting out into the trash.  I am very disappointed.  I am disappointed enough to look for another brand next time around.  Too bad I ordered such a large quantity this time because it definitely was not worth what I paid.  I NO LONGER recommend Reed's Crystalized Ginger.,negative
best of folgers and better than a lot of other brands.......price is currently off the wall.  it should be 8 not 17 to 25 or more.,positive

I was drawn in by a Facebook ad.  All I can really say beyond what I said in the headline statement is their texture is flat out nasty.  I'm 60 and I've never tasted any chip that comes even close to being as bad as this.Bottom line:  My two cents is avoid like the plague.,negative
I bought for my mother.  She loved it!,positive
Very flavorful and is excellent for cooking!  A little goes a long way!,positive

We buy this brand whenever possible.  It's hard to consistently find the same flavor in stores or online so we get different ones if the other is not available.,positive
This made me miss South Korea.,positive
"Made of cornstarch this powder is wonderfully absorbent and leaves skin dry but silky smooth. The magnolia petal fragrance is terrific. It is a fresh, clean floral that is not too sweet or cloying. The container is easy to hold. The cover screws off without difficulty and it sprinkles as expected. An excellent product for babies of all ages.",positive
This is so so good. I hate vegan cheese. Every one of them that i've tried. But this is so good. It doesn't have much taste cold but it's amazing melted. I put it on Lasagna and it's a wonder. I will make vegan and non-vegan versions of my lasagne and use this on the vegan one. My friends usually ask for the vegan one after trying it because they love this so much.,positive
I just love it during this pandemic. Solid and genuine.. Highly recommended. But price is a little bit higher. Would love to buy again.,positive

"A staple in every house I've been in, I have enjoyed the Kraft brand my entire lifetime.  I much prefer the REAL Wisconsin cheese I might pick up at a roadside stand on a Saturday afternoon drive, or in some cases the packaged stuff by Sargento.  Still, these Kraft American singles are the go-to choice when grilling up cheeseburgers on the Weber gas grill.  This processed cheese product melts better than anything and tastes so good on a great big juicy burger.  It is one of life's greatest pleasures all wrapped up in a quality bun and customized by your own personal choice of condiments and sides.",positive

"These coffee pods are horrible! Coffee and grounds spilled all over the new Keurig and my counter (4 times).

"This is really good vanilla extract, in a bottle size that's much better suited to the amount of baking I do than the much smaller bottles available in my local grocery store.  Not a bad buy, either.",positive
Great product and especially great as a special meal for kids. Made these for my son's class at daycare and they loved the new shape (2 year olds).  Only wish they came in whole wheat.,positive
Seems like it did not get up to temp. It's got a very gummy feel to it once you start chewing it. It's not brittle like it should be. Other than that you can't be the price. Just wish it was better executed.,negative

Wish I would have looked at the negative reviews. I have purchase this product through amazon before but this time it came without a lid! Once the pop off lid is removed there is no way to seal the container which means you can use it once and after that it will be stale. Can't believe this is actually a problem?,negative
My package came open with no tea inside 😩 I’ll reorder.,negative
The sale price was very nice. Better than I can find in all the Chinese supermarket in Houston! This soy sauce is in high quality with full strength of  protein content. A better choice than the red version of the same brand.,positive
"My dad loves black licorice jelly beans. When you live in a rural area, it's hard to find them, so I was happy to find them on Amazon. He seems to enjoy them!",positive
I did not like this at all. It’s like putting a glob of grease in your coffee. Greasy and no flavor even though it said vanilla. In the trash can it went.,negative

It's good COFFEE ☕,positive

Exactly like the old-fashioned ones,positive
The worst product I've ever had. The taste is bad and smells like engine oil. Don't waste your money!,negative
"Great brand and product.  I like chia seeds and add them to my protein shakes.  What I don't like about chia seeds is how the stick to everything.  They are hard to get off my blender, glassware and teeth!  Ground chia seeds is the only way I will consume them.  The clean-up is much easier.  I am happy with products from Spectrum and their quality is always consistent.  I use their ground flaxseed as well.This ground chia is something I have and will always reorder every time I run out.  It is a staple for my daily shakes.  A great souce of extra fiber and omega-3 fatty acids.  I highly recommend.",positive
Love them so does gbabies great deal healthy way for a quick breakfast or snack,positive
I feels great and I love it.,positive
Ease and convenience to send to a grandson.,positive
This tea is on point. I use some chocolate protein drink as a creamer and this makes a combo of awesomeness! Creamy. Succulent and engaging flavors!!,positive

"I have been sold on Basmati rice for a long time. Best rice in every category - taste, smell, fluffy ness.",positive
"Up until now, my favorite K-Cup flavor was Emeril's Big, Easy, Bold. It is still good, and I still like it, but I'd been searching for variety. I stumbled upon this one by accident, and I absolutely love it. It's really dark and rich, and not burnt tasting like French Roast.",positive
"I have to say I love this cookbook. I have had many cookbooks over the years but I really like this one a lot. It is updated with the latest healthy advisements. The book provides you with some overview information at the front. The recipes are divided into meal suggestions for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What is great about this book is that it uses new and healthy ingredients in very easy to follow recipes. The best thing is that each and every recipe has a full page photo which is helpful so you can see what the meal should look like. There are so many recipes in here that I want to try!!!  Also, each recipe gives you the nutritional value per serving. I've been cooking for many many years, and I will find many things to love in this cookbook. It would also be good for any new cook just starting out. The directions are easy to follow and there is a list of ingredients for each recipe. There are also tips provided throughout the book. Beautiful cookbook and it would make a great gift.",positive
I’ve been eating these since I first went vegan in 1999.  What a treat!  All the fun of jello without the animal bones.  Tastes better too!,positive
"I have tried the regular and organic and they taste the same. It does cause some gas if I drink two cups a day, but I switched to this from over thirty years drinking coffee. Have more energy now after changing to this drink. Put a little, or a lot of whip cream and a few sprinkles and, “Popof” a wonderful hot drink to soothe me. The other great things is I can drink this late at night because there is no caffeine in it!!p",positive
Product arrived with a broken seal. As though it had been opened. I returned it.,negative

Liked that the product was fresh and not broken😊,positive
These are absolutely amazing! So easy to make and take only 5 mins. Tastes like store bought to me. Very good!,positive
"Wish there was an equal number of each kind, otherwise it was great",positive
Very good chai mix without milk powders. It's a little spicy with a peppery aftertaste. Perfect with a little almond milk.,positive
"I bought this product because I believed it was unsweetened as advertised.  Not true,false advertising. This has added sugar in the form of apple juice and extra calories from added oil.  No returns of course.  I'd recommend looking at other products.  And look at label instead of believing ads.",negative
Very good price especially since we can't find it at walmart,positive
"I’m so sad to say that these noodles tasted horrible, and the consistency was very gummy/gooey :(I was really hoping I’d found an alternative to conventional wheat noodles.",negative

I tried this brand in a sample box. The smell and taste are amazing. I could drink it without creamer & only stevia in it. Great stuff.,positive
Really enjoying this tea. Have had it for several weeks and have come to appreciate its unique blend. I most often make it black with water but will at times make a latte with a hint of sugar---and it is beyond delicious.,positive
Sooo good to eat,positive
Very freshGood priceFast deliveryYUMMY,positive
probably not in this weather,negative

Loved each flavor!!!,positive
"The portion size would have been fine, but it was spoiled, sour-smelling, and sticky. I had to trash it.",negative
tastes really good and healthy.,positive
"I liked the flavor tremendously. No too sweet. That said I tend to mix 1/3 juice to 2/3 cold water or half and half.Although haven't tried it this way yet, I bet it would be amazing in a smoothy with Vanilla protein powder for a cherry shake.In terms of value for the money I'd say it's a great deal!",positive
This candy import is great tasting & has a surprise inside.  IT's a must try!!,positive
Mouth-watering cherry candy!!! I order it monthly because it's that 👍,positive
This product was not good. They tasted stale and were really awful. Do not recommend.,negative

"The best coffee, I’ve tried others but it is well worth the price and even decaf tastes like regular.",positive
Found these at my local hardware store for a dollar a piece. These are only 50 cents a piece. They taste really good and last a long time. Will buy again,positive
They all arrived intact!,positive

"These were ordered as a treat for my twins 2/1st grade class......toys sent in eggs were all for girls....... poorly packaged..upon arrival, some eggs were crushed...I must admit I was embarrassed ...Delivery fee was very expensive",negative
"This tea is great! I keep it with me all the time. I use it at work and when I go to a restaurant. I order water and use this for my drink. No one can make tea like this. The best part it is all natural. I had to order thru Amazon because the stores in my area quite carrying it. Go figure!! Amazon has great customer service and fast delivery. I have ordered from them several times before, different products, of course",positive
"I’ve been using this product for years and finally realized I should write a review because it’s awesome. Obviously a high smoke point, but super mild flavor and I use it in and for everything.",positive
"[[VIDEOID:936d598b3b5ad6cd5b5315c8d807f239]] I paid for a plain bottle of syrup...dont fall for it folks.

This is honestly the best coconut drink I have ever had. It may become a new addiction!,positive
These cashews are from a facility that only processes cashews.  I’m allergic to other nuts and I don’t have to worry about cross contamination.  The cashews are fresh and delicious.,positive
"I discovered these mints on a recent trip to the Netherlands, and fell in love. However, this particular presentation was disappointing. Instead of a nice ""gift box"" with a fancy ribbon, I got a beat-up looking black box, sealed with packing tape, with an inventory sticker on top, and padded out with wadded up kraft paper. What's more, two of the mint rolls were beaten up pretty badly, such that the first 3-4 mints were in pieces. Given that the shipping box arrived in pristine condition and the gift box looked ""ratty, but fine"", I'd guess that the candy was crushed BEFORE they were boxed up.Normally I'd chalk this up to ""life sucks sometimes"", but if I'm buying imported candy at vastly inflated prices, I want it to be perfect. I'd order these mints again in a heartbeat... but probably not from this vendor.",negative
"I lived in Germany for years and learned how to make the potato salad. Preparation is time consuming, so I decided to go with the canned version. What a disappointment! It does NOT taste like German potato salad. It is runny like soup, is much too expensive, and the flavor is awful!",negative
Good 👍 price,positive
"I love hot sauces, and this has amazing flavor with a perfect amount of heat. Highly recommended.",positive
Made Halloween cake for a Halloween birthday girl!,positive
"The candy is extremely tasty, but they came melted together in one toi-hard-to -chew bunch! I can break one or two off the bunch, but basically I paid for nothing.",negative
This is so misleading. You can't advertise an item as vegan/vegan-friendly and put whey in it. Whey has dairy. Whey comes from milk. This is especially frustrating because of the lack of product ingredients listed. I was SO excited to finally find a good Nutella substitute. What a disappointment.,negative
I have been looking for a gingerbread coffee that tastes like many gingerbread men were sacrificed in the making of a delicious cup of coffee and I have found it!!! This coffee tastes great. I love the gingerbread and spice taste. It really is the best gingerbread flavored coffee I have had. This is my new go to for Christmas coffee.,positive
Use this on a butternut squash and people will think you are a master chef.Also pretty good in a bourbon.,positive
"If you have never tried chick-o-stick, look for it in the gas stations -- they usually have it in the candy aisle with the candy bars.  It tastes like a butterfinger without the chocolate.  I LOVE them, and these are the perfect little bite-sized pieces.  Nice to have on the desk at work.  They used to be amazon prime shipping, and here's hoping they go back to it!  I've ordered snacks/candy on Amazon before and have gotten some very stale products, but these were fresh and good.  Recommend!",positive
I was disappointed with this flavor. I feel like it needs more sugar and more lemon. The lemon flavor they use tastes a bit strange. My son won't eat them. And now I have this whole box :/,negative
"Every Pod in this pack tasted the exact same, instead of 8 varieties, I received 4 and they all tasted like cheap dirt. I was looking for a rich bold taste accompanied by the kick of a caffeine-fueled mule.  But what I got was an underwhelming box of dirt water flavor packets that have as about as much caffeine as a  glass of green tea.",negative
"Perfect consistency, fresh taste. Excellent Product.",positive
A little expensive. Very close taste to the real tomyum.,positive
By far the BEST cut of meat I have ever had. So tender and so full of flavor! Will buy again for sure!,positive
Definitely perks up my latte!,positive
I really like this juice.  Is great for feeling a little under the weather during a illness or occasional mild hangover,positive
Purchased two of them!,positive

"I love this tea, but it is a bit pricey",positive
So when I opened the box I was so disappointed.  I expected more but they literally counted each gumball!  Soent way too much money for hardly any product.  I won't be ordering this again from this seller.,negative
"I was so excited about these for S’more kits as favors at an event I was throwing. I’ve tried them before at trade shows and they were delicious but when my large order arrived  they were super sticky, all stuck together and completely unusable. The few that were not stuck together were stale and didn’t taste fresh at all.  I was so disappointed with this product. We had to scramble last minute to find new marshmallows. I would not purchase these again.",negative
This is a very good tasting juice that I drink every morning first thing. I was having problems with my legs cramping and I find that this has helped alot. I has some cans arrive dented due to the way they were shipped but I was always able to use them. The shipping wrap has improved. If you are looking for a good source of this product I can genuinely reccomend this for taste and price. It is also nice to mix alittle other juice with it for a different flavour.,positive
"Just started on the first flavor in the pack, and after ~10 times I am convinced these are the worst capsule I ever bought. To be fair I bought other types of capsule from this same company and I don't recall being so disappointed.",negative
please make available for ordering again,positive
This has become my favorite lunch. I just boil water with salt pepper and olive oil and fill up the bowl with a cup of this pasta. In two minutes my lunch is ready. I use extra water to make a soup.,positive
This is a great buy! The milk steams very well. It doesn't separate in my lattes after a while (others have). Flavor is great. I drink it alone with cookies. It has fully replaced regular milk for me. Also this package price is very good compared to other competitors and offers.,positive
"Delicious once in a while snack! Very rich. Doesn’t stick to teeth very much. Smooth with little pieces of salt for crunch. I keep them in the fridge so they come out of the wrapper easier, they are fine to keep on a shelf in the pantry, if they get warm they stick to the wrapper.  45 calories per piece. It’s pretty guilt free.",positive
"This is the best vegan mac n cheese by far. It's incredibly tasty, creamy and easy to make. I honestly think it's in the same league as Kraft's regular mac n cheese it is that good. The powder doesn't lump at all when I make it and we put it directly over the pasta as directed.",positive
"A great way to make drinking water very desirable, the flavor is exactly how you'd expect. Tastes amazing!",positive
Has everything I need! Really helps provide that extra energy for early morning or late night workouts. Orange flavor tasted great and wasn’t overly sweet.,positive
Second time making my own pizza dough from scratch and the pizzas were great. Just wish I had a hotter oven to complement the dough,positive

"I like Bob's Red Mill products. I was reluctant to purchase a gluten free product as I have tried other gluten free food items and they didn't taste very good at all. I don't suffer from Celiac disease but I wanted to buy this to give as gifts to some friends who do suffer from the disease and another friend who is just avoiding gluten. Before I gave it as gifts I tried them first. I was very impressed. I prepared it per the instructions and they came out really well and tasty. I made another package but I added a couple tablespoons of coconut oil to the mix this time. To me they seemed to come out a little more the way I like, softer and moister. Of course geographical locations definitely have an effect on how things cook. I'm in Phoenix so the oil may be helping to compensate for how dry it is here. I made another package when a friend came over and brought his 5 year old granddaughter. This time I added some chocolate chips along with the coconut oil. Yes, they were very good!",positive
Got a deadline to meet!!! No TGIF for me,negative

I threw it out after one use. Tastes like chemicals!,negative
I love this stuff! I got introduced to Body Armor when I was sick and out of sports drink. I love this flavor and it really is rehydrating. Not too high in sugar either and there are also low sugar options too.,positive

"This product came with a Warning label from the state of California - stating that is product ""can expose you to chemicals including lead & cadmium which are know to the State of California to cause cancer ...""

Very happy with the semolina flour and it was delivered fast.,positive

"I liked getting coffee without the flavors, the selection was excellent and we enjoyed all the different roasts. I have ordered inexpensive coffee in the past and it lacks flavor, it is usually very watery but this coffee is really good!",positive
Honey has an excellent taste. It has a piece of the comb in the jar which I love. Packaging if gift-grade.,positive
Love these candies with the fizzy surprise inside.,positive
"My body loves this veggie. I make green smoothies for a daily intake. I add mustard seed powder, which boosts the  power of broccoli, ginger powder (fresh, when I have it) + spinach, romaine & banana.",positive
Almost no flavor at all. Can barely notice this even when alone on a piece of bread. I find the positive reviews incomprehensible. Don’t wasre your money.,negative
Wow. I really love this flavor.  Thanks Crazy Cups for such a delicious flavored decaf coffee!,positive
My box was crushed and most of my k-cups burst open!! Bad delivery,negative
I didn’t realize it was a live plant. I hope it’s as easy to care for and grow because I typically kill live plants. We will see.,positive

I love these whole wheat breadcrumbs and use them alot but I can't find them in the stores anymore so I was thrilled to see they were available on Amazon.,positive
My husband loves these.  I bought them at the airport during a layover and then had to search for them as he loved them that much.  We now purchase these regularly and wish stores around us actually carried them.,positive
"I didn't think I'd ever have anything bad to say about Sour Patch Kids. How can you ruin perfection? Well, you throw a big blue rotten apple into the bunch. That's how.Blue raspberry is a fake flavor that tastes horrible, doesn't compliment the other flavors,  and taints the entire bag, causing it all to taste terrible. I've been hooked on this candy for years. It's sad they ruined something that was so enjoyable.When I saw the title said ""original"", I thought my prayers were answered and they decided to offer a bag with just the original flavors. Nope. They just decided to call this new mess ""original"".  Blue is not an original flavor.In any case, the bottom line is this: These original are not original, regardless of the claim, and the blue raspberry flavor makes this once great candy taste awful.",negative
I drink one of these every day over ice and it taste great. It gives me my B12 and that boost of energy that I need.,positive

The flavors of these lollipops are so delicious.,positive

"I have officially vomited in my own mouth, thanks to this movie.I expected the absolute worst with this movie, but I expected a heartwarming and pleasurable absolute worst. This is just terrible. Absolutely terrible. Terrible like Nazis spreading the black plague. Let me explain: Ewoks are speaking English. It's horrible.The villain girl looks like she travelled from the future set of Power Rangers. I really really want her to rise up from the ground and say ""At last! After ten thousand years I'm free! It's time to conquer Earth!"" The putties... er, I mean the big bad whatever the heck they are... they growl a lot. Many of them look like an even lamer version of the Cryptkeeper. The Cryptkeeper was pretty cool, but these guys were not.The only merit to this movie was Paul Gleason. This movie might have been better if he'd went to the bad guys and said ""If I have to come in here again, I'm crackin' skulls."" It would have been even better if one of the Ewoks was played by Judd Nelson, who mouthed his words as he said this.Also, that speedy little creature is pretty badass. Word to that.No word to the movie, though. I want to give this movie a two. I want to, so badly. There's a passage I have memorized: The path of this movie is beset on all sides by the inequities of terribleness and the tyranny of spin-off awfulness. Blessed is nothing, for this movie blows.",negative
"I brought my kids up on Loma Linda.  Once my grandkids were a bit older, they each received a giant can for Christmas.  Giant can hold 40 dogs. When my grandson was a teenager, he ate his whole can on Christmas day!He found out that was too many in one day. The whole family loves them.  My daughters favorite is pretzel dogs. yummy.",positive
"These noodles are AMAZING.  smooth, velvety to the mouth but also a bit chewy.  Just took a few minutes to boil them up to perfection & drain then add the delicious oil packet.  I couldn’t be happier.  I bought the medium noodle with spicy sesame flavor.",positive

"The Cayenne Habanero is my favorite by far, but all three are great. They have the essential balance of heat without neglecting flavor. Too often sauces either lack flavor in pursuit of pure burn or are little more ketchup with hint of cayenne. These do not disappoint.",positive

I ordered a variety pack to try from 310 and could not wait to get it so  I ordered the vanilla from here and got it in 2 days. I have tried many replacement powders but wanted to get one with a cleaner ingredients option so I bought this one with less sugar as well. Not sure what the horrible aftertaste comes from but by far this is the worst tasting product I have ever bought. I have followed everyone's ideas to no avail and can not get past 2 sips and the aftertaste lingers so long that I eat stuff just to try and get rid of the taste in my mouth. I asked for help on their website and asked if the other flavors were better and wanted suggestions for mixing but they did not accept my review saying it was against their review policy. Now I know why on their site they only have good reviews. Going back to the health store and getting their recommendations. Or hoping the other flavors are better than the vanilla. But I do not recommend this flavor.,negative
"I love this stuff.  I use it in fruit salads, on pavlovas, and in cocktails.  It's far cheaper when bought in Australia, but if you're desperate and living somewhere that you can't get hold of fresh passionfruit, it's a great substitute.  It's a shame it's just so horrifically expensive here in the USA.For those complaining about the seeds - just swallow them, don't chew. They are part of the passionfruit.  I try and buy a bunch of these every time I'm in Aus and bring them back for recipes.  If I'm really up the creek without a paddle, I'll buy them on Amazon.",positive
"This vanilla is so much more flavorful than your run of the mill, grab off the grocery shelf version. I put it in all my smoothies. I also sell caramels and wouldn't dream of using another brand.",positive
"I bought this mix to make for friends who with were with us in New Orleans, where we ate them.  I was so excited to be able to do this!  I followed the directions to the letter - the dough was horrible; I had to use quite a lot of flour to be able to handle it.  The beignets did not rise at all when frying.  I am so disappointed in this product.  I was so looking for to making this treat.  Big disappointment!  I made half a box, and ended up throwing them away, along with the other half of the box.",negative
The best Applewood tasting bacon ever! For years we were getting our bacon from Costco but could not find any longer Applewood just Hickory.We got 2 packages from Fresh a week before Memorial Day and what a surprise!Trying to buy it again but is out of stock :(,positive
"Normally aplets & cotlets are soft and easy to chew or bite into and supper yummy. This box, the wrapped candies are too hard to bite.  I have thrown away over half of the candies so far.

I do not think Amazon should accept items that are damaged and then send them out.. I had planned on putting the cans in gift baskets. Unusable for this and not sure if the syrup is safe.  I opened one and put the syrup in another container and it seems to taste ok,negative
Awesome coffee. Great flavor. ☕☕☕,positive
"This is the one I have been use so far. Not like other tea the scent or taste is flavor added. This really orgarnic tea, the taste and the scent is really natural, and keep long last even left for hours. Suddenly, after hours the scent and taste will degree by 50% but still there, I think that is normal. That's why I still keep my auto shipment, because I did not find another better. Just a little concern on the color of tea after brew, it's yellow more than green as fresh green tea. If the company can improve this color will be perfect.",positive
"We went to the Japanese market near us today and bought a bunch of Pocky flavors.  We have had it before, and we love the chocolate and strawberry, which are the flavors most likely to (maybe) be found at our standard non-Asian grocery stores.  We got chocolate banana (5 stars!), cookies and cream (5 stars!) and matcha green tea.  I am a FIEND for all things matcha.  It is common knowledge among my close friends.  One of them got me green tea ice cream for my birthday and another brought me home green tea cookies and green tea Twix on a recent trip to Japan, as well as a bag of matcha to try making my own things.  I was prepared to LOVE these.  I was so psyched on them that I bought the double pack, even though it was crazy overpriced.  I ate one stick and for the first few seconds it tasted good but then it was just NASTY.  Devastation!  It tasted like sweetened SPINACH SOUFFLE!  It took more than 10 minutes for the spinach taste to wash itself out of my mouth and I drank about 8 oz of sweet tea hoping to get rid of it faster.  So now I have a couple dozen more sticks that I will end up tossing in the trash or offering to some other poor soul (with a warning).  Don't waste your money on this flavor unless you want to experience what spinach would be as a candy.  Buy one of the other amazing flavors!",negative

Best nut free butter ever!,positive
"Very disappointed. I have ordered this in the past and they were perfect. I ordered then again and this is what I got. The weather has turned cool so I figured they wouldn't be melted, very wrong. It looks like they got warm enough for the peanutbutter to bubble out of the cup.  All the candy was soft, squishy and poorly formed.I contacted amazon about them and they said they would send a replacement. Well that one was taken to the wrong carrier, or so the amazon rep said, and was deemed undeliverable after 3 days. So now that halloween weekend is ruined I complained again, they said they would send a second replacement. We will see if it actually gets delivered and if this pack is any better than the first.",negative
"I wouldn't have to buy this online but I haven't found any stores that stock it in Wichita. Hellmans mayo doesn't even come close, breaks down quickly an just doesn't have the flavor.",positive
I returned this item as they were dented and 1 exploded so tis was reshipped today and this is even more damaged than the first one and both we damaged before putting in the shipping boxes as they were dry!!

As expected. We buy cayenne in bulk. I would say this is the lower number on the heat rating as tis not super hot as other cayenne powders we have had. But very good and glad to find organic in bulk.,positive

"This is the best brand of coconut oil I have used.  Tried Nutiva and it is not in this brand's class. Smells wonderful, melts at 76 degrees.  All round a wonderful product and prompt delivery by seller.",positive
"Full disclosure: I bought this on my business account but have to post my review from my personal account.I'm a cyclist and I've eaten my fair share of their coconut/cashew nut flavor over the past...couple years? Has it been that long!? Anyway, I love it during long rides, but I also reserve a handful of packets for the occasional daytime snack simply because it tastes amazing and keeps my hunger at bay for surprisingly long periods of time on just 170 calories. This new flavor might be even better than their other flavor. Regardless, the variety is much appreciated!",positive
"Not that great, pretty dry.",negative
The worst apple what ever you call them! Don’t waist your money! Had I not opened them I would return! They are like a apple marshmallow and chewy. Gross,negative

"These are nearly calorie-free, starch free noodles that you can use in recipes if you are trying to reduce the amount of starches you are taking in, but love the texture of noodles.  They are mostly just the soluble fiber from a plant.  There are some things you need to know about these. They are shipped in liquid, so there is a heavy shipping fee due to weight.  When you open each package you then drain the liquid out, rinse off the packing liquid, and prepare the noodles.  If you prepare the noodles using the instructions on the box, you will boil them for a couple of minutes, then fry or sauté them briefly.  Then you would place them into other recipes.  The noodles by themselves have very little taste and a chewy texture.  They are very reminiscent of clear angel hair rice noodles, but slightly more chewy.  I happen to like that chewy texture so much that I just rinse the noodles off and throw them into soups or my steamer with veggies, or boil them for 2 minutes and them throw them into some sauce or another recipe.  If you want them less chewy, you can boil them longer.  You can also fry off the extra moisture to improve the texture for some things.These make a very nice noodle or spaghetti replacement that is not difficult to prepare, if you want an alternative to spiral cutting spaghetti squash or other such tricks.",positive
Beans  were very thin and dried out and hard had to use to make extract not good for any baking recipes for cutting and scrapping a bean pod,negative

"This tea has no body, no flavor.  Weak as a kitten, should have clued in to the price.  They'd do better to forget individually wrapping tea bags and put more tea, bergamot oil, more substance to the tea bags. Cannot return this item.",negative

"I've watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting, considering medical facts that can be learned. But this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the show's characters. Everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone, even during office hours, which is ridiculously unrealistic. There doesn't seem to be one solid, lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show - everyone is broken up and on the prowl - hardly a true reflection of all Americans. Indeed, there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and it's truly fulsome.Then we are presented with endless little moral 'dilemmas' and they're generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who doesn't agree with the all-knowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice. For instance, in one of the latest episodes we're presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and Addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because we're supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on. Anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupid.And I think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats pro-lifers. Addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds. The general feeling was that if you opposed abortion, you're a freak - hardly the popular sentiment in the US. Two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets, in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression. What's more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in. The script could have been written by Planned Parenthood.All in all, this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far-fetched medical situations throughout the whole show.",negative
Great value; reasonable price,positive
Corn pottage puffs- basically cream corn flavored puffs. Matcha chocolate bar- good at first bite...bitter aftertaste. Several different brands of Senbei crackers & puffs- yum. Carmel corn soda was interesting- burnt carmel taste. Baskin Robbin Ramunade flavor chocolates with pop rocks- wow! Big bag KitKat pudding flavor- yum flan! Veg crackers- tasty tiny triangles! Fromage corn puffs- basically Cheetos with a lil sugar and no artificial coloring. Fish shaped wafer with lemonade cream filling- yum! Ramunade candy- fizzy.All that's left to try is the ice cream flavored waffle and the Neopolitan instant noodles.Delivery speed from Japan was excellent!,positive
Great fresh flavor and rich robust taste. Not too pricey for a tasty treat!,positive

"It does come with the little whisk as shown in the picture of the product listing. The flavor is strawberry milk tea, super delicious!I used it in my French macaron filling and it was such a hit! I made the drink and it was delicious as well, will need to get myself some boba pearls to enjoy it for tea time. Will buy again when I run out. I wish they make a second option without the whisk so I can buy more at this price without getting a new whisk each time.",positive
Tastes just like lemons.,positive
Love the taste of it!  It becomes my morning healthy and energy drink.,positive
"I warned you...don't open the container...you'll be tempted to try one of these delightfully soft, chocolatey little treats.  Then it's over for you.  You must leave the room immediately, or you won't be able to stop.  They are good.  Try them.",positive

"They taste good, but I have to hold the button on my pixie machine because they are to hard and as soon as I press the start button it shuts off. I tried it with the one we have at work and it does the same or sometimes it's a very slow and forceful drip.  Now I am stuck them I guess if anyone use them let me know. Like I said they taste great.",negative
They are life savers as I’m on Paleo and this is my only sweet.,positive
Love the taste. Definetly orderagain.,positive
"I like it.  My cats, not so much (I tried feeding my pets medication using this after hearing other success stories).  Plus coconut oil is claimed to have antiviral and antibacterial properties.  I find it useful for first aid for pets since they can't be treated with traditional human medicines like polysporine when they get cuts.  Rubbed this stuff on a pretty nasty cut that my cat got on his head from scratching.  Within a day it was gone.",positive
Looking for a healthy snack?  I had high hopes since I love Apple Cobbler.  But this is too dry and doesn't have a strong apple cobbler flavor.,negative

Then I found Bradford Earl Grey, my only is regret is I have 5 boxes of other brands to work through before I can make Bradford my daily go to Tea. I love the flavor, and to me it beats all the others I have tried, and had a nice aroma as well. Love, Love, Love this product...",positive
Fresh cut grass I luv it! I’ve tried Barao and Yucay is definitely a great chimarrao!!,positive
"Dark chocolate tasted great. Worked for melting and covering strawberries as well as putting in cookies. Also delicious for mixing as chips with nuts for trail mix. However the white chocolate while it was delicious, it did not melt and would not cover strawberries. It was fine in cookies or as trail mix.",positive
Arrived like lighting - the candy is really good!  Many Thanks!,positive
The best I have ever had. It tastes so good when you make sloppy Joes that I eat every morsel after it's cooked right out of the frying pan before I add the sauce and seasoning,positive
Not top flavor.. too expensive I would rather pay more 4 Starbucks brand than this.,negative
"This is totally different from store shelf cinnamon. It has a rich yet mild flavor. I use it every day on my oatmeal, toast, etc.",positive
It is immoral and illegal to price mark up items in times of crisis. 54.99 for a 80Pack of small water that retails for $5 is Inane. You have been reported,negative
I wanted to like it as I like the pouring opening in the package. The taste is ... like a more bitter more stale and more old Folgers coffee taste. Going to garbage,negative

Second time I have ordered this and both times I received with what I could consider short-dated product.  Have to believe Quaker / Amazon can do better than 3 months remaining shelf life on 100+ bars.  Great product but not so much if it goes out of date.,negative
was a gift.  Arrived smashed and leaking,negative
I have tried a few of the recipes on the box and they have a very weird taste.  Pizza crust are terrible!  Almond flower is much better in my opinion,negative
Bought this as a gift for someone who loves this hot sauce. It's not available here. The three bottles were packaged well and the expiration date is over a year away.  Gift was well recieved.,positive
These were fresh and tasty.  I like them boiled and they make great boiled peanuts.  I use my instant pot to boil them and they come out perfect.,positive
Last day at  to the bone,negative
I bought this in the grocery store a few months ago.  It was just awful.  We'd bought two bottles (on sale) and ended up pouring them both out.  I will steer clear of all Smuckers syrups after that experience!,negative

This came packaged really well nothing broken or torn it was well protected. amazing this plant came out of that box. Really beautiful plant… side note spider mites have taken over my beautiful plant this is what is left… I am trying to save this plant.,negative

You have to chew up half of them at one time before it starts to taste like a pickle. Enjoy the $4.80. You wont get no more.,negative
Great treat and low calories and carbs unless you make a pig out of yourself,positive
Product was not harvested in time .it arrived eith flowers and seeds . Also it was heavily infested with bugs and I had to throw away all but one cup of the basil.,negative
"The taste is really bad!! It has a strong after taste. You can not even hide it with salt and pepper. I do not know if it would taste good seasoned, but I would not bother trying. It is a shame because I love the packaging and consistency. I’m just sad I wasted my money.",negative
Class until 9:30  yes on a Friday,neutral
Great product. Gives a pleasant flavor to food. Fast delivery,positive
"I'm a picky eater and didn't expect to really like these, I just expected them to be a barely-tolerable replacement for other sweets. These. Are. Amazing. They are almondy and soft and not crunchy or dry like other brands. I'm definitely ordering more!",positive
"I gave this Bosco chocolate syrup a try and decided that I'd just be better off without it.  I'd rather have my sugar free treat, with my almost sugar free whipped topping without any of this syrup because the aftertaste that kicks in after the rather good chocolate taste is off putting, and getting more and more so now that I am getting accustomed to tasting it.  To me, it's not an acquired taste but rather an acquired distaste.  I'm throwing the rest way.  Nice try though.",negative
I was very upset to get very dented cans some leaking and had to throw out.  Most other cans are full of large stems.  I opened one can that was basically a large stem with a few small green beans.I would only order this as last resort to keep your pantry stocked.,negative
"The cereal diet is boring. Don't get me wrong, I love cereal, but going on the ""special K"" diet just messes with your head.This cereal bar helps! As has been said in other reviews, it is reminiscent of a rice krispy treat, but it is a little denser, not really marshmellowy or buttery and more like a cookie. I'm not using it as part of the cereal diet, but just as a snack instead of a candy bar. It is satisfying like a candy bar but with only 90 calories and with cereal as the first ingredient.If you're looking for a healthier alternative to a cookie or a more interesting snack than a chewy bar, this is a good way to go.",positive
"The only down side I have is the spider came in pieces in the container itself, but that's understandable due to the fact that it would be extremely hard to ship it and keep it intact. It is very dry, please have something to drink when you eat this, but it didn't taste bad. I think you'll get more of a thrill on the idea you're eating a adorable cute and loving spider than you will the taste.",positive
"These flakes have a very strong parsley flavor that I was not used to having, so less is needed.  These are also much larger chunks than I am used to, so bare that in mind if you plan to serve this to green food haters.",positive
"This used to be the absolute best cold brew I have ever tried. Until recently...I noticed the taste had changed for the worse. It was overly sweet and had a strange, chemical taste to it. When I checked the ingredients, I saw they have added TSP as an ingredient. There is absolutely NO excuse to add a harsh detergent to food! It's not healthy to ingest and tastes terrible.I sent an email to the company and, though they responded fairly quickly, they gave the typical ""we don't care"" canned response. If they don't care about their customers, then their customers should search elsewhere for a product that isn't filled with harmful ingredients.",negative

"My daughter and I love making pumpkin bread and pies during the holidays. Libby's is a trusted name, and is always a quality product. The 106 oz can is huge for home use, but if you are making a lot of pumpkin breads, pies and other desserts during the holidays, this may be the best way to go. It ends up being 6 cents and ounce, which is an amazing bargain!",positive

The packaging was very small like a vending machine. Was very disappointed.,negative
"Flavor is good, spicy",positive
Yummy but I'll never buy again at that price! I thought at $30 I would get a good amount. Nope these are 3 tiny bags with a miniscule amount of candy in each.,negative
"The quality is very nice. I even picked some random beans and put them in a pot. They grew after one night. I didn't cover them with dirt or anything, just threw them on top of the soil so I could easily watch them sprout.For those who complained that it's damaged:- To plant beans, you should soak them in room temperature water for 2-3 hours, but don't over soak them because the sprout will be loosened and break.- Plant 2 beans in one slot to ensure at least one would grow (in large farming scale)Perfect for quick homemade soy milk and soybean snack.",positive
"As any Keto lover knows, trying to find a Keto dessert that matches a processed white sugar dessert is close to impossible.  When you're on Keto and haven't had sugar in awhile, this product is perfect!!  I like the regular chocolate chip dough.

Nope that's it the stuff was nasty I even tried freezing it cause it was so sticky.,negative

"Something in the mix separates and gets a bit slimy. Doesn’t matter how hot the liquid (water or milk) is, or if you stir constantly. Just a deeply wrong texture.",negative
Hands down the best addition to our pancakes that we couldn’t found! Perfect balance with all purpose flour. Literally 1tbsp of this stuff is gold!! my family loves it and I’m bummed it’s sold out but as soon as it restocks I’m buying as much as I can!,positive

I thought it would give me all the alertness and energy boost it said it would.The taste its not bad. But my batch of tablets arrived like they were expired or something.One of them was even slightly opened. That was definitely not good. They were a bit crushed too. I'm sure that isn't the way they're supposed to be.Won't be buying again.,negative
Came right on time and they are DELICIOUS!  They were sealed tight when they arrived and I have since used some for homemade ice cream.  They are full of beans and flavor!,positive
Pretty tasty and a great topping for your oatmeal or yogurt with fruit. Very healthy and yummy way to get your almonds.,positive
Bottom line up front: Kimera offers more than just a caffeine punch. I feel mentally alert and ready to start my day. This is everything I need to start my day off on a positive note.,positive
"NOT AS ADVERTISED—wasted $11 because item is non returnable and I don’t want to risk a friend getting sick if I give the candy away. Complete sham!Candy was somehow moist, not the right shape, was rock hard and came in a plastic bag that was nothing like the advertisement.",negative

"These make the best biscuits ever.  A bit crusty on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  And all you have to do it add water.  I wasn't sure about getting nine packets, but now I'm glad I did.  A biscuit for lunch with some cheese.  A biscuit as a snack with butter and honey.  ""I don't have anything good to eat.  Wait, I have biscuits!""",positive
These were good pistachios. I didn't get any bad ones. Nice roast. Will buy again.,positive
"Dissolves easily, great taste",positive
This chocolate candy is delicious. This is the Christmas treat that we give to all of our neighbors.,positive

"It's the best hazelnut coffee I've ever had. If you do not mind the price, you'll love this.",positive
"Tasty apricot flavor, with good heat, but not so much as to overwhelm the other notes.",positive
DE-LISH!!,positive
Another healthy and tasty product from Pacific! If you love Tomato Soup 🍲 you won't be disappointed! Best tasting soup with healthy sodium content. (This is my secret ingredient in my Shrimp Gumbo and it makes it taste richer then ever!) ..I guess it won't be a secret anymore! 😋😋😋,positive
"This is the actual best BBQ in the world. We do not have Sonny's where we live, and every time we drive to Florida we always buy like 10 bottles to last us through the year. Being able to finally buy it online in such a big quantity has been a game changer. It is hard to fit this in the fridge because it is massive, but if you have a fridge with good space for tall things I highly recommend it. It is really sweet BBQ sauce so if you aren't into that, don't get this. It isn't like too sweet where you want to die. It is just perfect.",positive
"The entire Ben and Jerry's non-dairy line is fantastic, and this is probably the best of the four. It's certified vegan, and obviously lactose-free. This is an awesome choice to keep around for my lactose intolerant friend. The ice cream is thick, rich and fudgy with ample gigantic chunks of brownie...very delicious. Almond milk has a slightly odd taste in some products, but they did a fantastic job with this one - the taste and texture is almost identical to traditional dairy ice creams.",positive
"I love Rockstar, have since they came out and when they sponsored Mayhem Festival in '08 I was there in a heartbeat. The OG flavor is nostalgia in a can, when you can find it, and this isn't where you can.",negative
Very pleased with the product. It's fresh and very tasty. It arrived promptly and was packaged appropriately.,positive
"Really good. Buttery, fresh, not overly sweet. Perfect with coffee.",positive
Haven't had these since we moved from upstate NY 30 yrs ago.  Just like I remembered them ummm good!  I'll be ordering more soon,positive
"The product is fine , my wife likes it but it's way overpriced. Up until now I was buying the same product at Publix store two for five dollars . I misread the pack of 12 thinking I was getting 12 packages . Shame on me !",negative
Best sugar free chocolate ever.  A little over packaged and overpriced..but so good,positive
"Excellent tasting! I added blueberries and used a low carb syrup and it was a wonderful, low carb treat! I’m trying here and there to reduce my sugar intake and this pancake mix was very tasty. I recommend!",positive
"We just snack on them..very yummy!They're always fresh tastingThere's only 3 of us & we go thru a bag every month , my grandson can't leave them alone 😅 they're so good for us too.",positive
i'd recommend it to my friends. good snack!,positive

Best hot cocoa ever!  Simply delicious!,positive
These green onions come in handy when you're out of fresh ones!  Handy and great flavor!,positive
Kick Ass is a great bean for espresso. Grinds well in my Capresso 560 Infinity conical burr grinder. Smooth with no burnt flavor. Doesn't jam grinder while leaving lingering robust flavor after drinking.,positive
The taste was too sweet. They really need to improve their packaging. All the Gujiyas were broken into several pieces. I won’t anyone to buy this product.,negative
"Perfect sample package, most negative reviews are dew to user mistake you just need a good strainer.",positive
This is FRESH fantastic!!! Flavor! I first tasted and purchased it at the Charleston SC plantation that it was grown on.,positive
"This was my first time buying coconut oil. I did a lot of research and I'm so glad I picked natural's way.I used it as a hair treatment, and my hair was so soft and shiny after it. I love it.Normally I can't stand the smell of coconut fragances, and was a little worried about the scent of this oil. But thank God the smell is so subtle. I keep smelling it everytime.My mom love to use it in the kitchen with almost every dish, and taste so good!!100% worth it.",positive
Expensive for a small amount of product.,negative
"So glad to be able to buy these by the box,  They are a great snack, not easy to find at local grocery stores.",positive
"I used to be able to get it at Costco, but now it is not available at mine and I used it daily.It is great on grilled fish, meets and poultry (especially on BBQ). I'm lost without it.It's not available at Safeway or Raley's in my area.  I hope Amazon starts to carry it.",positive
This is my favorite brand of water enhancer!,positive
"Good mild flavored coffee.  Hard to find in retail stores, so buy online!",positive
Delicious and great quality! The texture reminds me of Lindt. Makes a wonderful gift for someone having a bad day. These come packaged in a single layer square box made of high quality paper/cardboard. Very nice looking. You receive 2 wrapped pieces of chocolate in 8 different flavors. Each individually wrapped piece has 2 sections easily broken apart to savor or share. I highly recommend! I'm also very pleased I bought 3. 😍,positive
High quality! Exactly what I needed!!,positive
"Turkey Jerky taste very, almost any of the flavors, but if you compare the price per ounce. The price also changes very regularly.",positive
these are amazing cant even tell no sugar is added... must have,positive
My husband absolutely loves these and was excited when he saw they were bigger.,positive
Good product.  No aftertaste.  Flavors coffee pleasantly.  Good treat for St. Patrick’s Day.😋,positive
"At first, i thought the yeast was dead; I proofed it with water at 118 degrees and had heated the water in the microwave,  but nothing happened.  Then just on the off chance, i did it again only I did not microwave the water I just used warm tap water and it proofed beautifully.  I also let my dough rise at a cooler temperature and it rose much better. I think this yeast does best at room temp.  Anyway  I love this yeast and will reorder",positive
"A bit of England in my hands in the desert. Fantastic, arrived so fast, great tasting and expiration date was well into late 2022. Well worth it, if you can find a hiding spot from your kids!",positive
I love but expensive.,negative
Changes water into a citrus flavor with little or no calories,positive
I can’t believe how delicious this almond butter tastes. I’m now anxious to try the other flavors.  So glad my daughter recommended it to me. Will definitely purchase again!,positive
"Not only is this licorice delicious, it's healthy and ideal for vegans with an added plus of iron, calcium and potassium in every bite.",positive
"This bread was very delicious ,I really enjoyed it.",positive
"I love the Tosi Organic SuperBites Vegan Snacks, Combo 6 Almond and 6 Cashew. They are very crunch and fresh. They have healthy seeds and good protein resources.",positive
"Hands down a superior hot sauce. If you like smoky flavor, and spicy hot sauce this is the sauce for you.",positive
The most delicious tea! Fragrant and mild enough to drink all day no sugar needed!,positive
great jerky snacks thanks,positive
definitely a great gravy for sausage gravy or dried beef ... now that I have to buy GF products.. I will definitely purchase these again and again .... cannot find these in grocery stores.  unlike the regular gravy mix which I used milk .. it is highly recommended you make the GF version with 3/4 water and 1/4 milk ......  love love this brand,positive
"The flavor and texture of these are amazing.  Almost similar to a macadamia nut but much creamier. Expensive, but I will be buying again as a nice treat.",positive
"Despite the fact the this bottle comes with a horrible dropper I still give this product a 5 Star because it deserves it. I am a first time user of a concentrated black elderberry extract and I am blown away on how great it is. The taste is really good BUT if your kid can’t take the taste you can add this on a yogurt or top it in a small amount of icecream. I start having a cough and took 2 dose of the suggested servings and the next day I feel better. I then take the normal dose the next day and my coughing have stop.If you can get this kind, this is so much better than the gummy kind and I see/feel the difference faster than the gummy kind.",positive
Good for camping without a perculator,positive
"I use a very small amt in my freshly ground coffee beans for just that extra added ingredient that makes my coffee just perfect for me!  (Then again...I'm a little ""nuts"" at 84 yo!).... smiles...",positive
"I buy these bars all the time at my local grocery store and they are always  soft and delicious. This batch from Amazon were awful. They were extremely hard and didn’t have much flavor.  I’m not sure if this was a bad batch or if they were stale. My advice is to by these bars at your local grocery because when they’re fresh, they’re really good.",negative
Am very caffeine sensitive.  Thus far no headache and am enjoying the blend.,positive
"This mix is just great,  I had to do very little cutting of the cherries ,This mix is great for the fruit cakes that I make and ship out to others. I would recommend this mix to any one that uses candied fruit",positive
Nice mix of pickled vegetables n fruits. Colorful n tasty.,positive
"If you like chocolate and the salty/sweet thing, get these. I love that each one is wrapped like a tiny ""today was stressful and you deserve this"" present. I bought these on a whim because we had no chocolate in the house. You can understand why I had to remedy that.These are good.So, so good.That is all.",positive
"There's something insipid about this coffee. I tried it three times because I rarely throw anything away. But after the third time the granules went in the trash, the glass in the recycling.",negative
It helped me a lot when I baked.,positive
excellent. best quality and freshness found on any of the different seeds and nuts I bought  from this company are superior of any other product are tried before. very pleased with all of them. recommended.,positive
"This has become my favorite coffee - and I've tried many over the years. With the first couple of orders the capsules were shaped so they didn't fit well into my pod storage I keep with my Keurig on my limited counter space. With my last order I found they had reshaped the pods and now they fit perfectly. Where I live (NE Montana) we have no recycling facilities, so unfortunately I cannot recycle, but for all of the others that can - hooray for Barrie House! On my reorders I have not received any samples, nor a travel cup...hmmm? Maybe with my next order... But I seriously doubt if I'll find another I love as well as this one as I prefer bold, smooth and not bitter...and it needs to hold up to my flavored (sweet cream) creamer and it does this so well. Ambrosia in a cup! I know all of you black coffee drinkers will cringe at this but my coffee has to at least be white...",positive
Good flavor arrives quickly,positive
"I am in love with this tea! Tastes amazing and helps you sleep, I wish I could have something with the same flavour to sip throughout the day!!",positive
Perfect quality at a too-good-to-be-true price.,positive
This product was a bit expensive but it has a great flavor.,positive
"Great coffee, at a good price.",positive
"I really really enjoy these almost no carb noodles and pastas!! They do smell bad like fish when you open the package, but rinse well and throw in a non stick pan, and pan fry to dry and the smell dissappears. And they do not taste fishy! Definitely will continue to purchase",positive
My son who has Autism is very picky eater.  Only likes McDonald’s hot chocolate. With this pandemic we can’t be eating out. I’ve been searching for this brand since I had tried it about a year ago. Loved how they are packaged easy to store..,positive
Tried this once a year ago and have been drinking it ever since.  Good both hot or cold.,positive
Purchased as a student gift.  They loved it!,positive
Really pleased with this rice. Big bag. Will buy again.,positive
"Great rub!  It sat on my shelf for a long time.  It came with a rotisserie set that I Ordered.  When I finally decided to rub some on some meat I was cooking in the oven, I was pleasantly surprised.  It makes meat taste delicious.",positive
"I loved the packaging and I love sweet potatoes, so I had to try these. The best healthy snack and gluten free. I wish they were sold everywhere!",positive
Great flavor and love the carbonation.,positive
Goes fast lol,positive
Three of the four jars were damaged.  The lids on two of the jars were unscrewed so all of the liquid had spilled and one jar was broken.,negative
"Followed the label's instructions. The tea had no flavor or aroma. It had a slight color shift, but nothing worth mentioning. So disappointing.",negative
"Does not work well in Keurig Supreme Plus. No good, no bueno. Set it to brew me a Strong 8 oz cup of coffee and it and out really weak and my cup was full of coffee grounds. And to top it off, it says Not Returnable. 👎👎",negative
They carry this at Walmart but its so hard to find it anymore. So thankful that Amazon carries it. I love my peppermints!!!,positive
2 most favorite candies grapefruit slices and corn candy. Haribo slices and jellybelly corn candy both found on Amazon.,positive
Smells like bacon,negative
If you did not like this product there is no joy in your life and I hope things get better for you.,positive
It tastes & smells awesome! Plenty of antioxidants no caffeine!!!  I know with every sip my body is thanking me!😉👍,positive
Great option when you are in a bind to make a quick dinner!,positive
Gave these to my daughters as Christmas gifts and filled with M & M's.  The grandkids love it.,positive
It just as advertised,positive
"As you have found out by now, it's hard to find a reasonably priced coconut oil, especially when you end up using a lot of it. I bought this for soap making. It is solid at room temperature, and you get your money's worth from Amazon, at least as good as you're gonna get. Works great as a cooking oil because you only have to use a little of it, but for soap you use quite a lot of it. My soap and my recipes both turned out great. Thumbs up for this brand and price of coconut oil",positive
"The taste was horrible, its more expensive than the store not worthy  it.",negative
The flavor is great.  Such a nice treat.  I wish they came in larger bags. One thing however is that they are quite pricey for the quantity. There were only 8 pieces in the bag.,positive
"I bought this tea because it wasn't going to be sweetened. I'm sensitive to stevia and it leaves an aftertaste for an hour after I consume it. I would not have purchased this tea if the Amazon Marketplace image of the ingredients list included stevia. I'm including my bag of tea to show the list of ingredients, which is different from the Amazon Marketplace image.Additionally, the tea doesn't smell or taste anything like vanilla.",negative
"The can is great, but the packaging was horrible!  There was no bubble-wrap in the box to stop the can from moving around.  The tin was in a box, and it was rolling all around with ONE piece of packing paper.  The chips are good but for $50 you could do better for the packaging! I mean come on for $50!!!  Really disappointed.  This could not be given as a gift as I had hoped.",negative
I really like the flavor of this tea.  It brews up great.  If you like green tea I believe you will like this.,positive
"This product is expensive, and the servings are very small.  Each 10-ounce box says '20 - 1/2-ounce servings'!  Wow - how much volume in a 1/2 ounce serving?  Is it about one tablespoon?",negative
"Bariani olive oil (and products, in general) is a quality, wonderful tasting olive oil. It is the only one we use. Great for cooking and dipping.",positive
"Yes it is Mustard,but the best. Only Yellow I use. I have tried others, and Plochmans is my Favorite",positive
My very favorite Mio flavor. Not too strong! Just the right sweetness.,positive
"A friend told me about this product. She is very health-conscious when it comes to food for her kids. One of her kids has allergy, so she has also been looking for good gluten free food products. She first found this line of soup base in a high-end food store in the East Coast and tried it out. Her whole family loved (and still loves) it. She sent me one as gift a few months ago and we tried it out and my kids love it too. We used to boil meat and vegetable or 2-3 hours and used the soup to cook food for the kids. This was very time and energy consuming. We tried other soup bases in the past but the kids complained about being very thirsty after drinking those. This one is great. It saves us a lot of work and the kids still get healthy delicious soup! I recently found it on Amazon & bought 5 different flavors. The order arrived within 2 days with my Amazon Prime membership and we now can enjoy the different flavors.",positive
"Perhaps the most foul thing I have ever smelled or tasted. We couldnt even finish cooking it before we decided it was not salvagable. ZERO stars...Im still gagging, and our house stinks!",negative
I keep rebuying themThey are delicious and can ship all year long without heat issues affecting them,positive
My husband makes pizza and prefers the jarred mushrooms. Nice enhancement.,positive
"I couldn't even touch the bottle, it smelled off!  I had to throw the whole thing in the trash.  the whole package was wet when opened.  There was no padding for the bottle in the envelope.  The fact that there's no refund is despicable.",negative
"Tasty, smooth texture, perfect size for a small treat.",positive
"I bought this tea to make kombucha and it does not disappoint. The results are a flavorful and delicious kombucha that I later flavor in a second fermentation, but this tea that I use has been the best so far.Will definitely keep on purchasing it and yes, I most definitely recommend it!!",positive
Santa got this for my daughter and she loved it!,positive
"Amazing ghee. I usually only buy a specific brand of ghee, but due to inability of my original one, I had to find other options. this has been perfection.",positive
Perfect texture for spreading and great tasting.,positive
"Great stuff!  I use it both dry, and mixed to liquid solution. Easy to use, tastes great, travels well. I wouldn't be without it.",positive
Purchased this for my sons school class for his birthday treat. It came super fast and the quality is great as shown in the picture. The kids loved it. This might be the new tradition of “school birthday treats.”,positive
Just like years back when I was growing up and these were everywhere,positive
"I have purchased this Snappy Canola Oil 3 times and love it!!! I usually pop the corn in Avocado Oil( better for heat and health) and sprinke the Snappy Canola Oil on the popped corn.  I love the flavor it adds.  Check the label....low saturated fat, 0 trans fat.  Guilt-free.",positive
"Confusing, conflicting descriptions on this item.  There is no aloe or honey.Go only by the ingredients list.  I like the texture of Bubble Tea, which uses tapioca, but found this less pleasant because the nata de coco is gummy and sticks to your teeth.",negative
Finally able to find this product they stopped selling in stores. This is the only product that takes a smal amount to use and not leave a gritty film. I will continue to order this product as long as it's offered.,positive
Really big bag,positive
"Excellent product and a good price.  I've used these Rotels in all kinds of recipes.  Everything from chili, to pasta sauce, to salsa.  If you have not tried ""prime pantry"" yet, you are missing out.  Not only is there a great selection of products, it actually saves you money by keeping you focused on your shopping list and prioritizing the items.  One of the biggest expenses for my family is buying as many item on impulse as we do our shopping list.  Prime pantry removes the temptation of buying items, buy color, packing, or other sales gimmicks.  It also has a very cool calculator that tells you exactly how much room is left in your pantry box, and makes excellent suggestions for what to fill it with.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.  How can you beat grocery shopping from home on your computer?",positive
"This is one of my go-to fast meal options. The fish is a good quality and always fresh. I'm a big fan of the rice, it's always perfectly done and the vinegar comes through, rounding out the flavor.I prefer going in store vs pickup for it so I can select the combination. Typically there's a tuna and salmon mix or salmon or tuna singularly. Sometimes there's also shrimp or a white fish. I'm a huge fan of salmon nigiri so I try to find that since it's my preferred.",positive
It was  very fresh. I used them to make vegan mozzarella and it turned out great. Great value for what you get.,positive
Great for bulletproof coffee while camping or traveling! Love this product! Only wish it was a larger serving size. Definitely will purchase this again!,positive
Love these candies and glad they were available for purchase,positive
It taste yummy!,positive
Yummy with roasted chicken,positive
A delicious snack with pretzels or an apple.,positive
"Even though these were fairly good quality, the majority of them arrived detached from the sticks. A little disappointed with that. Quite large for cupcakes but still worked okay.",negative
I use this to make sure I get the exact amount I need in my tuna.,positive
"great mix of my favorite crunch's, thank goodness for the lid or my hand would constantly be in jar",positive
"bought these for the ex in-laws.... huge hit, very well received",positive
"Always fresh when I order online, lasts in the fridge within the week (I eat it before the week is up), much better taste/texture than regular kale. I like it sautéed with olive oil and garlic as a side dish.",positive
Great healthy snack.  Good for snacking on.,positive
I was given the wrong flavor. Was given ham and cheese flavor instead of the cheese flavor,negative
Ordered 3 times. Hight point frying temp. Food tastes great. Decent price too.,positive
Love this sauce. Perfectly seasoned and perfect texture. Seller is excellent as well as delivery and packaging. Will continue to buy this product from this seller!,positive

Love them and they lasted a long time and tasted great,positive
I found out during my Keto journey I had an egg allergy so I was having a hard time at breakfast until I found Keto cereal. I love everything cinnamon so this was perfect for me.,positive
"Now that Amazon has eliminated carton boxes for shipping smaller items, this box of matzoh came to me in a sturdy plastic bag. Apparently during the delivery process the box was drop-kicked by gorillas, which turned the matzoh into many teeny fragments. Probably useful for making matzoh ball soup, but not so good for eating the original undamaged sheets.",negative
Love the product for the price I paid.,positive
These three products have a unique blend of spices that will enhance your food preparation,positive
Extra fresh,positive
There wasn’t really any flavor.  I was able to color it by using food dye.  A vegan way to use the gelatin.,positive
Lindor's milk chocolate truffles are always GOOD.  My daughter likes the white chocolate best.,positive
Love it for soups and stew,positive
"I was looking forward to these as my personal snack, ones my kids won't find, but I opened the package and reached in to get them, I usually don't look at the food but it felt weird and sure enough they were all moldy :( glad my kids didn't get the chance to take them to school and open them there.",negative
"I thought maybe it was super concentrated because the amount that came out didn’t look like a ton, but I took a sip of my coffee and it was a watery. So, I shook the container and realized it still had liquid in it. I tried a total of four containers this morning to try and make an iced coffee, and none of them gave me more than maybe a table spoon. The final one didn’t even cover the bottom of my coffee cup.I came to Amazon to request a replacement, and despite saying 100% satisfaction guaranteed- there is no refund or replacement policy. There’s no number to contact the company, there’s no website I can fine, which is the most first rating part - especially if you’re your having any coffee this morning!",negative
This product is super yummy I’m sure it’s probably good for you but I Wolfed that whole bag down in no time  honestly in my defense I couldn’t help myself !  I’m sure that’s probably not good for me but these were really tasty and I sure would buy them again.,positive
"I finally found the perfect plant base milk. It tastes just like dairy milk. Great for frothing, drinking, cereal. Great vegan alternative",positive
"I am very particular about everything I put into my body. I’ve gone through a couple different brands of matcha, and Akira matcha tea has been he best. I am someone who is allergic to everything, and if the product is not pure, it will make me itch. I’ve had no issues with this matcha. It gives me energy without making me jittery. I honestly haven’t felt this energized and ready to take on the day in a while. I drink a cup once a day, which is why I bought the 16oz bag. It’s worth the price. I will continue to drink for the rest of my life.",positive
Used to buy Calrose rice until I found this brand.  I've tried many others and this cooked perfectly in the Zojirushi rice cooker.  It was the ultimate perfect sticky rice.,positive
It’s really good. You can add more fruits or just the concentrate. I make my own smoothie every day.,positive
These  were  delicious  and perfect  I love these and a pack of three yes they  were packaged nicely and all the pocky  sticks were not  stuck together I give these a 5 star review,positive
"I love these little bits❣️I bought them for my grandkids for when they come and visit BUT... THEY ARE MINE, ALL MINE🤪 No, I have been known to share... Although, thinking they were hidden being on top of my fridge, I came into my kitchen and noticed some of the little bits of marshmallows on the counter by my toaster oven and some on the floor under the cupboard ledge? When my granddaughter came in for breakfast I looked right at her and said, “EVIDENCE!” She said, “what do you mean Grandma?” I just pointed to the fallen marshmallows and said, “I love you Jada, next time just ask me for some, I don’t want you to fall climbing around on the counter tops.” 😜",positive
Great taste and the pods are recyclable!,positive
"This is a great buy for these almonds, initially I ordered 6 pounds, and recently I ordered 8 more, would recommend to others",positive

They have seeds.,negative
Not as good aa the vanilla,negative
"Taste terrible! Never write a review, but this is YUCK! Do NOT recommend it. What a waste of money and effort!",negative
It wasn’t the flavor I was expecting. I was expecting it to be a bit spicy but it just tasted like bbq flavored chips,negative
"Okay, I fell for the Hype, I read the first feew ingredients and decided to try them, for like a YEAR straight. Yes they're sugar free, YES they're delicious but NO they are NOT healthy! I just discovered that they use partially hydrogenated oil in these! TRANS FATS!  So, here's something nice and logical. They tell you something is FREE of something offensive to health and then slip in something arguably MORE offensive to health, these garbage oils that are potentially harmful to long term health! How disgusting and deceptive this marketing is. Yea the idea is great, sugar free candies YAY! But I am NEVER purchasing these again due to the marketing deception of taking out one bad ingredient in favor of another.",negative
"Product has good flavor, texture, and no packaging off flavors, and the portions are convenient, since I typically use smaller amounts and a large package would go to waste.",positive
"I love this Pecan Butter, and everything I put it on is more delicious with the addition.  I even put some in my coffee to see if it would be great or a mistake. IT WAS GREAT!  I will certainly be ordering more.  LOVE IT!",positive
Great product product showed up as it was described and sell  sold as big bags that have individual bags of popcorn cheddar  Great for  Lunchboxes or for traveling snacks,positive
"Great, fresh product.",positive
"Good value for money, good quality. It's bigger than I expected! I'm going to use this as a general purpose cleaner for my washing machine and dishwasher and other things!It's food grade, so I may also use it to add tartness to fruity desserts or other foods.",positive
"This was my first time purchasing this brand of hash browns, so I’m not sure if they always taste this terrible or if I got a bad batch. They cooked up very quickly and developed a nice crispy golden crust. Looked delicious. Did not taste delicious. They had a foul flavor. Perhaps they were old. They went straight into the bin after the initial bite.",negative
"Adds a fresh, briny flavor to pasta. We love it!",positive
Spice it up and cry a few tears. A few drops and your family and friends will be sweating and crying.,positive
"These are just the best.  I cannot find the singles in my town, so I order them here and we have one every week!  Best dough and sauce flavor by far.",positive
This is the one. Much much better than Ito En Oi Ocha Green Tea.,positive
Love grandma browns beans.  We eat them in NY but can't find them in Florida.,positive
There are few brands of peppermint hot chocolate for a Keurig.  I like this one the best.,positive
I wasn’t so liking this but everybody else does I guess I need more bubbles or different flavor yes price was good that’s good for me now refreshing yes,positive
"I had to quit drinking coffee because one day I developed an allergic reaction to it, so if I drink any now it makes me very ill :(I really miss the rich aroma and the taste. A couple of years ago,  I discovered Morning Thunder tea,  and I have been hooked on it ever since :)No, it is not coffee and will never be, but I think this and Raja's Cup come as a close second for a nice roasted and robust flavor like coffee!Drink on!",positive
I like it! thanks!,positive
It’s hard finding caramel sauce let alone sugar free. But this is good. This allows us to add sweetness to our coffee at lower calories.,positive
"I love this stuff, and have eaten it since childhood. It’s got a rich, deep flavor that other mustards just don’t and it’s perfect in a salad dressing or sandwich. I will warn you that the jars are very hard to open the first five or ten times, but with use the lids do get easier to prise off. Maybe someday they will go back to the old cork and sealing wax lids, but until then we just need to persevere to access our mustard.",positive
"I bought this when there was a coupon and couldn't pass up on the deal!  I received the red one, which I plan to save to store Halloween candy even though the original candy it came with will be long gone!  Chupa Chups lollipops have been around for years probably because they are so yummy!",positive
"While I have not tasted these myself, as they are a gift, I am excited to give them to my brother and sister in law, both of whom love to cook, especially with a French flare. I'm sure they'll love these!",positive
Great dipping sauces for vegetables and chicken and shrimp's.,positive
Do not buy! Suppose to get 2 packets ( that’s what it said on Amazon) only got 1.😡. Misleading.,negative
"Great milk, very fresh and delicious.",positive
"I moved from Europe and there are mostly available dates from Iran and Jordan, which are exceptional, but these, which are a domestic product, blew me away, with their rich taste and fullness.I like to eat one with my coffee to add sweetness to the taste. ☺️Definitely ordering again as soon as I eat these.",positive
These flavors smell and taste delicious! I used them in cake and buttercream icing.,positive
The French sure know how to do jams well,positive
The seeds were not included in the box.The packet was empty,positive
"I was a bit skeptical and did a ton of research (which led me to understand you only buy the gelatinized version of this product) before buying. I have been using 1 tablespoon in a protein shake every single day for over a year or so and the difference is very noticable. This is not some miracle cure and it took a month or so to kick in. I am in my forties and after continued use, the libido went from 'eh, why not' to 'let's go!' and has stayed that way. I see no resaon to ever stop taking it. As for taste issues others have reported I suppose that taking it by itself in water would be rough but mix it in something with a blender (it dissolves great- no chunks) and you can barely notice it is there. It may also be an acquired taste as I now cannot notice it at all in the protein shake.",positive
i could eat many bags in one sitting. so good,positive
Easy to make.  Good flavor.  Variety pack means choices.,positive
"I wanted Ceylon cinnamon, was not expecting a very light flavor. You have to use so much, it changes the texture of the final product.Super disappointed",negative
My family LOVES this product. I am so happy to be able to eat pasta again. Blood sugar friendly and I really cannot tell much of a difference btw these and regular noodles. Now I'm holding out for a rice-like version.,positive
REALLY DELICIOUS AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE HOME TO GET MY ICE CREAM,positive
This makes cookie decorating a breeze! Tastes great ... it's a quality product. Lower quality ready made icing mixes have a strange almost soapy taste but not this one. It's fabulous. It's easy to work with and dries fast and hard so you can stack cookies or freeze them. Will never be without with stuff!,positive
Coopers Cask Coffee is the only way to begin the day. The taste is delicious and smooth.,positive
"The wife loves em, really helps get the milk going and keeps my little guy happy!!",positive
"These peeps arrived very quickly, but I am very disappointed in how they look. They are shriveled and feel more dense than usual. I have ordered these before and have had no problems. I was hoping to exchange or return them but apparently that is not a option for this item. They are still within the best by range so I’m hoping they are still edible.",negative
My military daughter loved this .. especially from being miles away from mom. Best starter kit,positive
I love this poster!! I got it framed. It’s informative and it adds personality to my kitchen. I started looking up more herbs and found out just how beneficial they really are.,positive
"I used to make homemade dashi but got tired of the large pot of dashi in that took up so much space in my refrigerator.  With this brand, you. just plop a packet in water, boil, and done.  Add miso and whatever else you put in your miso soup and it tastes just like homemade.  To my knowledge, it does not appear to have MSG or any artificial flavoring that other dashi packets contain.",positive
"This mayo simply tastes the best, I can't explain why.  I had to settle for Hellman's recently because I ran out of my Dukes.  Not the same.",positive
"Many of these have mold inside. They were stored in an airtight container in a dark cupboard, and they have been moldy since day 1.",negative
Only reason this was given 1 star is the top leaf was completely broken. The first one I ordered was much larger and in perfect condition.,negative
This is just the right size for my Mom💖,positive
Unusual flavor. Just really good will buy more,positive
"Definitely not a medium, more like a very hot. There's also no ranch flavor at all, tastes like nothing but straight jalapenos.",negative
Dirty and damaged product was arrived,negative

Good mis and price.Bought one for my great nephews and neiceAnd one for home,positive
To me it is hands down the best caramel for coffee.,positive
I love this product. It has a great taste and keeps me full for hours,positive
I made cucumber kimchi with this and it was deliciously spicy.,positive
"This is hands down the richest and fullest bodied coffee we have ever purchased. The coffee itself is smooth amd not overly intense, while stronger than a pikes place or sumatra starbucks roast.Buyers should be warned that this is a very fine grind. This has not been an issue for us in our bunn coffee maker, but it could become an issue if your coffe maker has a shallower coffe ground tray, as ghe fi e grinds can splash over and into your fresh pot.All that said, you will not find a better coffee for the price.",positive
This Greenhouse Grown red bell pepper is exactly as described. I would even say these look and taste better than the one in my local grocery store. They are huge and beautiful! I have ordered a couple times now and they are all the same great quality!,positive
Too much dye on the strawberries.,negative
"I have used K-cups for years and usually like Gloria Jean's brand, but I didn't like this blend at all.",negative
I bought these to make vanilla extract. It has such a rich smell and tastes good.,positive
Delicious garnish for nice cocktails. Once you’ve had these you’ll never go back to regular cherries.,positive
Purchased these for a bourbon tasting party. I expected there to be a lot of syrup vs cherries but I was surprised it was packed full. Very good cherries.,positive

"This is a very good product except for the price (1lb for $22!!!). It is the best tasting goat milk powder  out of the 3 I have tried. I recently bought another brand(1lb) and although I paid about 1/2 the price , I was not very happy. This goat milk is so creamy and taste so much better. It’s almost like it is not powdered milk.  You can taste the difference in  your pancakes.",positive
I have severe COPD which causes you to be too weak to prepare or even eat full meals.  I need supplements like this to get the protein I need and local stores don't always have what I need.,positive
"These little dark chocolates are really special. Very rich and flavorful, they are a treat to look forward to.",positive
Love this product for making French onion soup,positive
I now have this product on a bi weekly twice a month delivery and will add a little to this review as needed.  They have delivered with out fail since this scheduled delivery was started.  Can't get them at our Rouses.  I regularly eat nuts daily as a food item and they keep me away form mostly trash foods.  Love them!,positive
"I brought the ""Class Roast"" and it was very weak.  I normally brew my k-cup on the 8oz options and at 8oz it was very weak and tasted very water down.  I have tried many different brands over the years and these seem to me as the weakest of them all.  For the price, I would rather stick with a different brand.",negative
"I grew up with Blue Sky's Cherry Vanilla Cream soda - and I only enjoy these about once in a blue moon, but they taste enough like the original to have a nice childhood memory once in a while. The stevia sweetener is not overwhelming in this flavor, I tried the root beer once and cringed at the thought of trying any other ""Free"" options. Their ""Free"" Jamaican ginger ale changed my mind, but you can taste the stevia more in the ginger ale than in the cherry vanilla cream. This is VERY sweet tasting, just FYI.",positive
Best tasting coffee I've had in a while.,positive
I was so happy when I saw all the positive reviews. I ordered the mixed bundle and I can’t drink it. It tastes horrible .When you have fresh grounds and a proper grind you can taste the difference vs coffee that is not fresh.That’s exactly what I feel I got with my order. It was Old /not fresh and the taste was no where close to my nespresso capsules.I don’t mind spending 25 cents more for a morning cappuccino that tastes just as good as my 5$ cup from Starbucks.Don’t waste ur money. Unless u don’t know the difference and don’t care. At least I got my caffeine...Maybe it’s getting old because this product is from Israel ... bad shipping or long times sittinf in a shopping container before it hits the shelves?The pour is also bad. It almost drizzled our slowly and I feel the pod was not well engineered. When u look at a nespresso capsule it has a totally different mechanism than these pods.,negative
"Woof! I wouldnt feed this to my dog. It smelled terribke, chewy like leather...what a waste of $.",negative
"my favorite store bought bottle juice is evolution's essential greens with lime. it's extremely low in sugar and it's high in greens. it tastes absolutely awful, but it's really good for your body and skin!",positive
"Best tasting sugar free candy out there!! ***BEWARE***Xylitol is the 3rd ingredient. I’m usually very diligent about keeping them locked away from our pets. This time, our dog got into them and ate about 10 of them. $1500 later with 24 hours in a vet ICU, he should be ok. It can cause liver failure and low blood sugar. Our pups bs was dangerously low after 1 hour!!  Thankfully he’s going to be ok. I’d still buy them...they are THAT good!!",positive
We love it over cream cheese and spread on crackers!,positive
This tea is amazing. It has the real flavor of cerasee which basically tells me that this tea is real.,positive
I was very disappointed in the the flavor of the tea. The strongest flavor coming through was the water with witch I made it with.,negative
Fresh and great condition. Thanks!,positive
This reminds me of Bibi caffe that I used to get at Nordstrom in the 70’s. So delicious with ice and half and half. Yum!,positive
I drink this tea every day in place of coffee.  I can’t drink coffee and am enjoying this tea as a substitute.  It has a lot of flavor.,positive
"The product is advertised as white, incorrectly.  The product we received was pink. We needed these for a Christmas party.  Epic fail!",negative
The Quaker Old Fashioned Rolled Oats comes in 2 bags in a big box. The box might be too big if you don't eat or cook with a lot of oats.,positive
"I'm always hesitant about trying an sort of energy product; however, this product caught my eye!  Why do you ask? The answer is simple...its loaded with all your B complex vitamins, caffiene, and is organic!  This product has an amazing orange/bananna flavor which tickles your taste buds.  The energy drink has no bitter after taste, and I noticed increased energy with 20 minutes of consuming.The label on the bottle has a complete list of ingredients and is very detailed about the consumption and use of this product.  The Vita-V company was friendly, quick shipping, and very willing to help with any questions I had! In my honest unbiased opinion, I believe this is a wonderful energy drink simply because of it taste and its ability to provide me with the necessary energy I need..did I mention there's no bitter after taste?!! I did receive this product at a reduced price for a review; however, I purchased extra simply because I was that truly impressed with the product!",positive
My most FAVORITE JUICE,positive
I like the challenge and taste it was great.,positive
These citrus candies were awful. The seller should not be allowed to sell a product in this condition. You can tell by just looking at the product that is not edible. They were hard as a rock when they should have been soft and chewy. I usually check the return policy before I order but I didn’t do it this time. It says the item can’t be returned and no information to contact seller.  I guess this is a lesson learned. Don’t order from this seller.,negative
Love this company. I used to buy cheap spices at the grocery store thinking there wasn't a big difference but there is!,positive
I've been ordering Teas' Tea for a long time. Love the taste. Much cheaper via Amazon as my local store charges around $2.65 per bottle.,positive

Small and poor taste.,negative
"Greetings Amazon Shoppers!I absolutely love love love this flavor! It’s great on its own I also add my other vitamins that I need to take better liquid form with this and I take it with my pill vitamins as well. Best bang for my buck and easy to blend with my diatomaceous earth product. I loved it so much that I shared it with my kids who are adults and just as busy as I am. I am so thankful I found this product and gave it a shot!Please note: THIS IS NOT A PAID REVIEWI am just a mom of (6) kids and (2) grandbabies who wants others to know this was a great purchase for me. I highly recommend anyone to buy this product!!Kindly,Christina Love(North Dakota)",positive

Awesome product!  Highly recommended!,positive
Colors are weak,negative
These lentils had either insect casings or a disgusting additive amongst the lentils.  I discovered this after I had cooked them.  Avoid the nausea and do not buy these.,negative
I have loved these pops since I was a child. Every summer we would drive across country from CA to NJ. My mom would give us these to get some quiet time. We didn't care. I have always kept a bag around the house. Was thrilled to see such a large bag!! So I took a chance and ordered.  So glad I did. They are fresh and just as I remember. I was so pleased I immediately ordered a second bag and I am thinking of sending my sister a bag,positive
Excellent coffee! Will definitely be ordering again!,positive
"I've been wanting a tea storage box like this for some time and this one coupled with the large assortment of tea is more economical than most. The box is made of bamboo with a plastic insert in the lid. Magnets hold the lid lightly closed, though gravity does the work mostly. Mine arrived in very good condition and I prefer the plastic over glass as its less likely to break. However, it is also more likely to scratch so cleaning has to be done carefully. It smells very ""woody"" when you open it up which is a pleasant scent.The tea assortment is very diverse. I favor black teas, but I liked the multitude of options including decaf tea. It's a very luxurious experience opening it up and surveying your options. There are enough slots to separate the different types of tea by type (black, green, fruit, herbal, etc.). This was a gift to myself, but I think it'd make a very nice gift for any tea lover as the box makes a great impression.",positive
One of my favs.. Its fast.,positive
These are GREAT!! So cute! & well made. I made party favor popcorn boxes for my daughters bday party!,positive
This is a very over priced mixing bottle. I do like making my own dressing.,positive
"I read the reviews and was skeptical about purchasing it but it was easy to open and the flavor is Awesome not too spicy but a nice kick- I add it to eggs, fried rice and more 👍🏼",positive
I’m very selective when it comes to chocolate consumption. The Ovaltine Chocolate Malted Breakfast drink is the best. It reminds me of my childhood. Guilt Free.,positive
"Great deal for a great product. Much rather have these in stock for my kids than ""junk"" juices or soft drinks. My kids love these",positive
"On subscription, price beats Walmart. Son's favorite flavor.",positive
"Always fresh and tastes awesome! In fact, people I've given it to, after roasting, have suggested I should get into the coffee business. I am a complere novice. As such, you can be sure this is some good stuff!",positive
Hubby loves this house blend by Starbucks.  Just ordered more k cups from Amazon the other day.,positive
Like really good hot chocolate,positive
"Saw the Special Sauce for sale on Prime Day and thought I would give it a try. I am glad I did. The taste seems similar to yet not as harsh as the sauce one gets with a fluffed-out fried onion from The Outback or Lone Star Saloon restaurants. I have tried this thus far on chicken strips and chicken fried steak, and liked it both times. I may just be a repeat customer.",positive
"Liked the coffee, but the price spike made it not worth it",positive
Good quality coconut oil.  Came as specified.,positive
"I’m not loving the price , it’s a bit high!!!!But I LOVE LOVE the flavor",positive

Kids love mac n cheese and this is really easy to make and tasty.,positive

First time I bought this I received the full 6 pack of 10. The second time I received 1 box but paid for 6. I ordered a replacement and I still only received 1 box 😡,negative
"Ok. So it's not 100 percent pure vanilla extract, however the flavor is phenomenal. I've had nothing that compares to this brand of vanilla. World class. The flavor is what is important to me and there is nothing better than this brand.",positive
These thing are delicious!It’s like oaty peanut butter and jelly!I take these with me on road trips as a stomach settling snack.These are a essential item in my pantry.,positive
Love this herbal options,positive
Great product. Super fast shipping. Continued customer.,positive
Hands down my favorite new snack. One bag lasts a long time because they're very satiating. Really good crispy texture sort of similar to astronaut ice cream but a nice garlic mushroom flavor. Any mushroom lover would enjoy it.,positive
Just love cinnamon,positive
Half the sodium of other salts. This is the preferred Kosher salt of chefs who know. Many recipes you’ll find calling for kosher salt are ruined with other brands. This is the one to use. Stay away from that blue box with the yellow umbrella...,positive
This is my favorite brand of stevia! It sweetens well and you only need the tiniest bit. I use a pinch or two (tiny spoon comes with it) to sweeten a whole pitcher. Love that it’s organic👏👏,positive
"These are basically pellets. They don’t cook properly like regular oats, and are disgusting.",negative
I am so addicted to these,positive
Great crema on the Crema purchaseGreat taste price is much much cheaper than nespresso.  Used in an Italian household no complaints on flavorBtw I bought the aluminum capsules not the plastic ..never had one malfunction in over 300 cups,positive
Great accessory for a snow cone maker.,positive
"Received box of four, one jar broken and salsa all over. Tried to get replacement and it said not eligible for replacement/refund. The box was big enough for six jars with nothing to keep them from banging together! Very disappointed. The salsa is great but kind of expensive especially when I paid for 4 and only got three due to broken jar!",negative
I’m sorry to announce that I will no longer be purchasing Nonnis Biscotti as the price has doubled.  In fact at times Costco had the same product for $6.50 a package of 25. Until the. Price comes down I will give up my favorite snack.  So sad.,negative

I loved the freshness of my buckwheat gerbs. These are very good and I recommend them. Matter of fact I have them on subscribe and save so I can always have them on hand.,positive
"I can't believe this has been around for years.  I just bought some about 2 months ago. It was so delicious, I wanted more, and now I can't find it.  Why do products that are GOOD disappear from the stores?!?!?",positive

Every so often I purchase these pistachios as there’re my husbands favorite. He is always happy when I buy them.,positive
I used this to make my own coffee creamer. I thought it wouldn't work as well but it's wonderful.,positive
"Don't do like me. After reading numerous descriptions looking for the best deal I thought I had found it. After all, you can buy a 7 oz can for $1.5 in most any grocery store. I didn't realize I was paying $16 for one12 oz can. Apparently, the descriptions all ran together after a while. $16 for a single 12oz can is INSANE.  The product is good but this seller is ripping you off.",negative
The syrup bottle seal was broken and leaked all over the pancake mix packaging.,negative
"I use this mainly for deepening any chocolate dessert I am making, from icing, pudding, to cookies, this makes the chocolate flavor jump out, without overpowering. Great product!",positive
"Absolutely delicious!There wasn’t enough time for a decent picture. Popped a good wine open with this. The flavor transported me to Spain. Deep, nutty, full of meat and aromatic. This is not your regular “ham”. Nothing beats a good Serrano and this is on my buy again list.",positive
It has no flavor because it's not supposed to. This is an extract,positive
Most of the cups don't work on the Keurig Machine as describe. Waste of money !!,negative
Cant go wrong with this brand,positive

"I wish I had paid attention to the brand here. Same inconsistancies as their jar olives for which I've previously submitted a photo comparing jars.5 bags - 3 different lot numbers.2 bags bright green olives in clear brine, 3 bags drab green olives in cloudy brown brine.In all bags, the texture of the olives range from mushy to firm, are salty and no one has mentioned they are very sour. Just like green olives without the pimento. These shouldn't be sour at all - like black olives. You can soak away the salt and sour but you can't soak away the slightly odd flavor that these Castelvetrano olives have. On the plus side, with the acidity and saltiness, these things should last 100 years. I mean, there is no expiration date anywhere.",negative
Arrived fresh & on time!!,positive
"The product was extremely dry and was  expiration . I was so disappointed. These were a staple in my home in NY as a kid and as an adult . When I left NY and moved South, these products were not available. I wish Amazon too would sell their entire line , BUT at a reasonable rate , these are generally around 3.50 per package . Amazon did credit the purchase .",negative
Best price i was able to find for these! Thank you!,positive

These are great bars.  They have a ton of flavors and are always fresh and inexpensive.  Guys in my family eat these daily.,positive
These are my favorite chocolates. I’m very pleased with the chocolate condition.,positive
"I shy away from jarred salsa because it usually tastes really fake, processed and like vinegar. However since I love the On the Border restaurant salsa I thought I would try this. It is REALLY good! Very similar to their salsa served in the restaurant and unlike other jarred salsas it has no vinegar in the ingredients. I am looking forward to making the On the Border tortilla soup recipe that you can google. It is so good and I bet will be even better using this salsa in it.",positive
"Wet, tastes like apples.",positive
"It took a little experimenting to get the thickness of the coating just like what you find at Hooters, but I've got it down now. I toss the breast strips in the breading mix a second time after letting them sit in the fridge after the first breading. Then it's straight in the pan of canola oil at 350° until golden on the protrusions. Drain on some paper towel while loading the next batch into the oil and then it's into a covered bowl for a quick toss in some Hooters ""Hot"" wing sauce which I can actually find locally.Taste just like the real thing, just without the cute servers and multiple tv's to watch.A good substitute for their mozzarella sticks and marinara are the ""FarmRich"" brand sticks and Emeril Lagasse's ""Homestyle"" marinara, both of which are usually easy to find at Walmart.",positive
"This is great cheese! Most cheese in the US dusts their wrappers with corn starch without labeling it but this company doesn't, this is great cheese that is safe for my moderate corn allergy. Love it!",positive
"Every time I buy this brand of saltine crackers, each sleeve has multiple crackers that are in crumbs.  Not all crackers are broken, but I still have to throw them out. And, these crackers are so pale in color.  They should have some browning...Going to buy  Keebler next  time.",negative
Perfect size easy to use. Product tastes amazing!,positive
This product must have been on the shelf for years. The candy was like rocks and might break a tooth.,negative
"Highly recommend. Delicious pick-me-up, with a tangle of flavors. The salty/sweet/tart is a good combination. The cranberry and dark chocolate compliment each other. It's a good thing that each pack is only 150 calories. I sometimes have a morning and afternoon pack.",positive
Great tea nice selection,positive
Great taste worth the money,positive
I LOVE THIS OIL but the top of can got dented and now it doesn't seal properly.I'm going to have to use up this pricey oil quickly because it not able to be stored like this. Too messy to return.,negative

"Around our house we refer to this as ""Crack Tea."" Nuff said. I grant that I have found the most expensive way possible to make a cup of ordinary tea, but it is convenient and tasty.",positive
"I use to love Healthy Choices Split Pea soup. But they took it off the market.I've tried Campbells Chunky version.... horrific nasty ""smokey"" taste.... like I'm licking a burnt wood-log off out of a fireplace. Whatever artificial smoke-flavor they got going, it has got to cause cancer. Artificial smoke is disgustingThen I've tried this Amy's Soup version of spilt pea. Well it was green and it was soup... but veeeeeery  B L A N D. I couldn't even taste the peas. If I were blindfolded, I'd be guessing at what I was eating. Very little pea taste.I then tried Amy's Soup Vegetable Soup.... same thing. B L A N D. No robust taste. Tasted like a lot of flavor was missing.I don't get it.... how Amy's Soups can charge $2.59 a can for something so bland.If I were at a restaurant and had the same soup... I would send it back and ask that the price of the soup be taken off my bill.Sorry Amy.....your soups don't taste like anything. It's all flavorless paste..",negative
Mine were not soft and seemed stale right out of the bag.,negative
The taste is the most important thing to me wanted old fashioned Christmas candy.,negative

Our favorite breakfast,positive
"Please bear in mind that I am a fan of salt licorice when your read this.  These salty fish have a nice balance of black licorice flavor and salt / NH3Cl.  There will be no mistaking this as salt licorice, however not too over powering.  Texture is similar to a gummy candy with perhaps a little less bite.  These are different shapes but generally about 1.25 inches in length and 1/4 inch around.  Most of the salt seems to be in the powder adhered to the outside of these candies.",positive
"This company is nothing short of amazing with quality products and customer service. I've had a monthly delivery of their MCT oil for the past year and I couldn't be happier. This product not only has MCT oil, but also cacao and ghee, which makes your bulletproof drinks twice as nice.",positive

"I use this flour to make bread weekly, and even used it to start a sourdough culture. I'm partial to the Bob's brand, and this flour doesn't disappoint. Bread comes out delicious every time. I've also used it for pie crusts, pizza dough, and to make gravies, and haven't had a problem with it. The case of 4 packs is also a great deal over buying it at the store individually.",positive
[[VIDEOID:a7fa7d3cf2e9f9fed226ab1a60df7905]] Got a 3 pack. 2 of the 3 bars were not eatable either melted or something got to them for they were missing parts and discolored!  Not happy at all,negative
"The current price, $10/kilo, is absolutely ridiculous. You will not find better coffee at that price. I do not imagine myself to be a coffee connoisseur, but this coffee is every bit as good as the $15/lb Italian Roast from the local bean roaster.",positive
If you like Jamaica this is pretty good stuff.  And reasonably priced,positive

The peanuts all tasted stale and the bag is so thin that it broke open in transit. That meant the contents was just falling out when I got delivered.No returns  and no refund!I advise against getting this.,negative
"As with most “flavored” coffees, these have very weak if any extra flavor. And the base coffee is poor.",negative
"Delicious, smooth and mild flavor. I have on auto reorder so I never run out!",positive
I've been frementing mine for only a week and they're blossoming beautifully!,positive
"I have never like an energy drink so much. I randomly came across this brand watching some YouTuber’s video and it sounded cool. Two hours later I bought some at my local Whole Foods. Fizzy, limey, and just a hint of green tea. Since I found them on Amazon in a 12 pack for 24 bucks (in stores they are 3.50 a piece) I went ahead and purchased. No more 2 pm crash!",positive
I ate the entire thing in one day. Absolutely delicious. Great product from Lebanon. Will definitely buy again!,positive
"So good, I wish I could find these in the stores around here, these are my favorite kind!",positive
great present looks soooo good,positive
"The sauce itself is really hot, which is what you expect, and the flavor is unique when compared to most jalapeno/habanero sauces. I've only used it sparingly, but it improves the flavor of otherwise bland foods.The greatest part about this product, though, is that you can get other people to willingly try it, and the reactions are priceless 9/10 times. You discover who has a good poker face the other 10%.",positive
After reading reviews I expected to this to be so good.  It was AWFUL.  The flavor and smell (I ordered cinnamon spice) was awful.  It was like eating perfume or essential oils.  I do not recommend.,negative
Takes too long and outrageously expensive,positive
Item arrived damaged and box smashed.,negative
I was very happy with this product and the speed in which it was delivered. My only problem is I did not order the right product. I wanted black seep powder so I just ran the seeds through the blender.,positive
Worth it for the surprise!,positive
"I absolutely love this! Great on fish tacos, sandwiches, pizza dip … and more. Will definitely buy this again!",positive
"We love the noodles. If you’re expecting them to be regular noodles, you’re going to be disappointed. You definitely have to boil them in beef or chicken stock, then dry them out by frying them.",positive
The taste is very organic and natural tasting. Not chalky or anything of that sort. Had it just mixed with water and it tasted just like spinach. I'm sure it can be added to any protein or other drink. Great way to get in my veggies for the day and it being natural.,positive
Alway a buy from me,positive
Great idea flowers in a Chinese container with a fortune I got for a friend as a Mother’s Day gift she loved it. Maybe Bc everything is so expensive today this gift was over price .,positive
Not able to open cans with tabs as they broke off. A scissors  was needed to open the cans. The flavor was flat.,positive
This is about $2 cheaper at grocery store so I don't mind getting it here. Only thing is u get to look at it in store and I bought one of these the other day and it was all fat!! But I've bought 7 total so getting one bad one I'm not gonna give bad review,positive
THIS IS MY FAVORITE CANDY. I'M GLAD I CAN GET IT ON AMAZON SUGAR FREE WHEN YOU CAN'T FIND IT IN THE STORES. IT HAS THE GREATEST TASTE TO BE SUGAR FREE. YOU CAN REALLY BECOME HOOKED ON THE RED VINES.,positive
Bought this for my Mother in law’s birthday. She loved and enjoyed it.,positive
"bold yet smooth, some aftertaste but it's so good it doesn't even matter",positive
"The best salsa I've ever had, not too hot. I can eat this with anything. Worth every penny.",positive
"I bought this product after reading clinical trials that prove that a well known artificial sweetener may cause Diabetes! (Hint, its in a Yellow Packet) Well, I'm trying to AVOID that, lol! So I threw mine out. Next I tried Stevia, my husband has been using it for years but I NEVER tried it. WHY, I thought? I had the other Non-caloric sweetener, but things have obviously changed. So I finally tried that BITTER, NASTY Crap in my Green Tea one night...YUCK!!! Stevia tastes like its a straight ""Punishment"", lol! Like I did something wrong, he he! DOUBLE YUCK!Next thing I needed to do was find another calorie free (preferably natural) alternative OTHER than Stevia. After much research as far as finding something with a Pleasant taste it was a toss up between this product and Munk Fruit....so GLAD I tried this stuff first!! Its granulated just like sugar. Has NO flavor except normal Sweetness. No powdery taste that those unnatural sweeteners have when you directly taste it. It stores well and LOOKS like the REAL THING. (it even looks more like ""Sugar"" than ""Sugar to me!  Check out my side by side comparison and see for yourself!!) I bet you could replace this product in your Sugar bowl and NO one would even know! A little pricey but seeing that I only use this in Tea, oatmeal and other breakfast foods I don't need to sweeten much! I will happily be using this product for the rest of my life.....now if my Husband can keep his grubby little hands off MY sweetener and stick to his toilet water we wont have any problems! I can hear him blending ANOTHER smoothie using MY new wonderful sweetener as I type this!! lol :)  GREAT STUFF!!!----UPDATE:  So, when I wrote my prior review I was over the moon for this Product BUT I had only used it that ONE time in Tea....had an ""Interesting"" trip to the restroom soon after BUT I didn't fully put things together and plus I wanted it to WORK for me SO BAD! But its official today, it caused me MAJOR diarrhea, nausea and cramping so much so sadly I cannot use it again :(  My return window here passed so I cannot return it or get a refund...I will leave it for my husband to try, hopefully it agrees with him better. But yea, 3 TABLESPOONS in my hot breakfast cereal and it was all over for me, lol! Glad I wasn't in a restaurant! (well, that's out anyway due to Covid) And I'm over 200 pounds! I cannot imagine how it would hit a more petite person. Do the research, gastrointestinal issues are common with Sugar Alcohols. Still taste great! Good Luck, it MAY work just fine for you!",negative
Very dry and not much inside filling,negative
I order this product all the time and It comes right away and I get great service. I highly recommend.,positive
"This is NOT RAW!!!!! I don't know what the other people are talking about who claim that it is, but I have worked as a raw food executive chef and educator at Crudessence in Montreal (look it up to see that I'm not lying) and I can tell you that this is most assuredly NOT RAW! Raw carob powder is a very light beige color and doesn't taste anything like cocoa. Roasting/toasting carob destroys it's nutrient content and flavor.",negative
A great-sized portion for a senior citizen. Great price.,positive

Must be old or poor quality it was aweful weak,negative
"A really sizeable percentage of this package are empty shells.  I took 2 handfuls of pistachios with me to work as a snack and there were 26 full pistachios, 2 unshelled pistachios and 8 full sets (16 pieces total) of shells.  So, of 36 ""pistachios,"" 8 were just shell with no nut meat.  That's more than 20%.  No wonder these are so inexpensively priced.  They're more than 20% shells!  Really disappointing, considering I bought the 3 lb size.",negative
Needed this for Xmas cookies.  Found it on Amazon.,positive
these are horrible . They are hard as rocks. will never buy from them again. We can't even eat them,negative
The flavor was good and the season was good.,positive
I love using these to take the place of whipping cream or use with my coffee.,positive
"This milk alternative is the best we have ever tried. I did a trial run with this can before buying in bulk. Just for kicks, I made the milk as directed but poured it into a washed out, empty 2% milk jug. No one in the family missed a beat drinking the entire gallon. After I was certain it had passed the taste test of all family members, I came clean on what they had been drinking. Every single one of them said keep buying that and that it tastes the same or better than what we had bought for years. Now, we always have milk. The threat of bad weather or what have you will not have us running to the grocery, nor will power outages leave us with soured milk. We will never go back to store bought again.",positive
Great value!  They went quick in my home.  It's the perfect size for packing in my kid's lunch bag!,positive
Too bitter! Not recommended,negative
I can only find this type of pickle at Amazon and very glad I can. I used to get Krogers sweet dill strip pickles but that was over 10 years ago. These are very good and the texture is very crisp. I wish the skin was a bit more tender but still very good.,positive
very good product as I am using it for long time and very satisfied from the flavor.,positive
"I did not have any of the icing problems I saw in the reviews. My whole family loved these. It's nice to have pop tarts that have better ingredients than the brand name, and the flavor was fantastic! They're a bit pricier than regular or store brand Pop Tarts, but totally worth it to have a great taste and good ingredients (no high fructose corn syrup!) that even the kids love.",positive
Good value for quality product.,positive
"While I am a fan of spicy hot foods, I don't like hot for the sake of the heat. Without flavor, hot foods aren't worth it. These chips really hit the nail on the head with a great balance of flavor vs. heat. Don't misunderstand, they ARE hot, the kind of hot that brings a bit of sweat to the brow after a few minutes, but delicious. Just make sure and have a cold beverage handy before consumption and enjoy hot treat!",positive
Fresh taste and sent,positive
Always like sending great grandkids a surprise !,positive

"I love rice a roni, the flavor is wonderful. Four of my boxes were badly damaged and some were open. Don't know if it's the supplier or if this happened in transit.",negative
"Words cannot describe how elated I was upon the discovery of these onion chips. I was deeply disappointed once I could no longer find Dang’s branded onion chips, and this product was the saving grace. The large package has proven tolerable, as these chips stay crispy for several months with refrigeration and resealing.",positive
"I have always loved those little miniature tabasco bottles but they just aren't practical when your husband works ridiculous long hours and you're packing him a day's worth of food every night. These bottles are perfect! Depending on what I'm cooking, sometimes he'd rather have hot sauce like Cholula, so we tested it out and Cholula, Tapatío, they work fine with no leaks! Ended up being really glad it came in a pack of 2, one for Sriracha and one for hot sauce :)",positive
"Look pretty good, haven't used for cooking yet.  This will last me a very very long time!",positive
Great if you are making dirt!,negative
Very hard gumballs we ended up throwing them out.,negative
"I didn't know whether to buy it or not based on the reviews - some people say it's amazing and some say it's gross and tastes like cardboard.  Sorry to say that I definitely agree it's gross, and I think I'd rather eat cardboard.  In fact in made me want to throw up and I was sick the rest of the day. It's way too expensive to experiment (I soooo wish I hadn't), and they don't take returns on the second unopened package if you don't like it.  I'd give zero stars if I could.",negative
"It really is the best tasting iced tea on the market. I make it all summer, but, this is a treat!!",positive

I was so excited to receive these nespresso pods but once I tried them I was off put by the taste. There is an odd perfume taste to the coffee. My husband and I both don’t care for the taste so I ended up ordering a different brand.,negative
This tea is wonderful hot or cold!,positive
I am so far thrilled with the product. I am hoping the price comes down a bit so more can afford to pay for it and learn about it's benefits.,positive
Delicious!!  Love the vanilla wafer!!  Can’t get enough.,positive
Great coffee - I definitely will reorder.,positive
"I love them, because they are so convenient to use.",positive
This is not good popcorn.  Very little of the corn pops.  What does pop is tough and mostly kernel.  I would not suggest buying ever.,negative
Kids wouldn’t even eat it. Flavor was certainly off (not in a good way). Boarders on too soft. Must have gotten a bad batch?,negative
"I have not tried it yet, hope it is good as it smells.",negative
"Order two, and received them spoiled. They were so rotten they stunk!",negative
These are pretty darn good for low carb Diet . I do recommend,positive
A little really goes a long way with this.  I love it.,positive
Delicious! They arrived very fresh and did last long in my house.,positive
This is a wonderful mild coffee with no bite to it.  Great flavor.,positive

"When Trader Joes stopped making their own brand of whole bean decaf coffee, I went on a mission to find an equally good value in whole bean decaffeinated coffee.  Finding great whole bean decaf coffee is easy. Finding it at a good price is hard.This is it! Great value and better than the TJ whole bean coffee it replaces. Loving it every morning.",positive
"Fresh, crunchy & not salty.. They are the best we've ever had. 👍",positive
Gift this Christmas. She lovedit. Thanks,positive
"These apples are quite crunchy and have an excellent taste. Being that they are just apples there are no bad ingredients. Just an apple that's been dehydrated. Good for snacking, school lunches, or outdoor expeditions.Somehow they managed to put 6 apples in the bag. More apple goodness to share!",positive
Great buy. Our family uses these packets often. The bulk size goes a long way. Much better price than buy smaller boxes at the grocery store. I recommend buying this to save you some money.,positive
"Very dry, no flavor and way too pricey.",negative
"Smells wonderful,  tastes fantastic!",positive
"It doesn't look like much when you receive it, about a tablespoon inside a tiny zip bag but I followed the directions and two weeks later, my grains are growing nicely (about doubled in size) and I am enjoying!Update********Since my kitchen has gotten warmer, they are really taking off. I even made some soft kefir cheese by letting them ferment an extra day, stirring, then putting through a strainer so I can reuse my now 3-4 tablespoons of wonderful, live kefir grains. Then into a piece of muslin to drain. You don't get much cheese (mostly whey, which hey you can drink or water plants with) but it's cool.I am almost ready to give some extra grains to family.I highly recommend this product and am enjoying my mini, healthy science experiment. Why make yogurt when kefir is so much easier?Update 7/10/13These grains are still making a great bunch of kefir...so pleased!",positive
These are my absolute favorite crackers and they are very hard to find in the store. So happy I found a source to purchase from.,positive
"Bought a box of this in the local store for my wife and I ate most of it.... Well, needed to replace it I checked in with Amazon first. Discovered it comes in threes! I probably ate most of these too, but in the confusion my wife hopefully managed a box on her own.Don't buy it if you can't resist chocolate and nuts, it's hard to stop eating this stuff.....",positive

I love this herb company I was so happy to see that I Could order with them through Amazon my hibiscus is amazing I have used it in several tea blends by itself in my spiritual practice the quality is amazing the flavor is out of this world and in comparison to Hibiscus that I bought last year through another company this is hands-down 100% better than it is intoxicating,positive
"If I could give less stars I would. This oil arrived in complete liquid for, I figured from the heat of shipping. Even after being in a cool place, it never solidified, which made it impossible to use. The container is not good, and it leaked everywhere which then attracted ants. I do not recommend that you buy this, go to an actual store so you can get a better product.",negative
I read about Simply Gum in the WSJ and immediately ordered a variety pack. Love the gum and the fact that there are no artificial ingredients. My whole family loves the different unusual flavors.  Great product.,positive
They always eat them,positive
Very easy to use for my products,positive
Muy ricas .pero muy pocas por paquete,positive

Great tasting product. I take it along for energy on backpacks.,positive
Was hoping to find something similar to what I used to get in Denmark when I lived there for 3 years. This is wonderful!,positive
"Way overpriced and tastes wrong, like it was left in the sun. Thought it would save us the long trip to the Asian supermarket, but it was a waste of money. I guess we'll drive.",negative
"If you google ""squishy circuits"" you'll find the best play dough recipe! It calls for a lot of cream of tartar which isn't cheap but this one seems economical.",positive
Came neatly wrapped and were perfect for our little party favors. None were broken - which was my main concern.,positive
Tastes is bitter with horrible aftertaste.,negative
Delicious! I love this seasoning,positive
The bottles are worth more than the price of the whole thing.Drink the water and then put the empties through your dishwasher a couple of times to get rid of the labels. What you have is the best fridge water bottles. I keep 6 or 8 in my fridge at all times. There's nothing nicer than reaching in there and taking out a green bottle of ice cold water. Put one on your desk and one by your bed and give everyone their own at a meal.,positive
Great Chowda!!,positive
These were very goodUsed in my popcorn machine on standEasy to cook and definitely a higher quality kernel with less waste and hulls,positive
bought this as a gift so I haven't heard anything yet,positive
"I completely love and appreciate *this* brand of these seeds.  In a pinch (both supply and financial), I have had to turn to other brands.  NOTHING compares.  I know this type of thing is, generally, subjective, but I prefer the absolute bitterness of these seeds.  Among other selling points, of course.  Thank you for providing seeds that at least make me *feel* like I am getting the benefits for which I purchase them in the first place.",positive
This is a favorite in our house and I was pleasantly surprised I could get it through Amazon without having or attending a party.,positive
"Tasty, with identifiable ingredients.",positive
"This is smooth and full of flavor, I enjoy it as my afternoon delight coffee. The service is fast and well packaged as well. Each cup is fresh",positive
LOVE THIS SAUCE!,positive

My wife loves these. The perfect low calorie snack for late evening coffee or tea.,positive
I was looking forward to having c &h sugar as I recently moved to Texas and cant find it anywhere down here.  Unfortunately both packages arrived and were hard as a rock.  I will have to toss it out as not eligible for return.  Im very disappointed.,negative
"I ordered a 6 pack because I love Chai tea. But this company shipped Chia tea that expired the day I received it. I didn't notice the expiration date until after I had opened one of the containers and made myself a Chai Latte. It tasted extremely bitter and was really gross. I looked at the expiration date and the date said October 31st 2018, which was the same day I received the product. Gross!!! I would suggest buying this product from a grocery store. I don't care how much I would have saved buying in bulk, but really I ended up losing money since the product was bad.",negative
Great Candy.  The REAL thing. A must-buy ! Super-Fast shipping !,positive

"Fabulous flavor, always start my day with at least two cups of Earl Grey tea. Bigelow tea bags are the best.",positive
This is a repeat order. Highly recommend it.,positive
Coffee is good and the price is good for the product.,positive
"What a horrible company that would price-gouge in a time like this. When we should all be pulling together and helping our community, this company has chosen to take advantage of people and raise the price astronomically. A normal bag is in the $6 range - today they are selling for $24+.",negative
Get this stuff! It's amazing.,positive
"My husband and I both love this coffee. While it's not an extra bold k cup, it still has a nice kick to it without making you feel too jittery. Also, it has a light coconut flavor, but definitely not overpowering!",positive
The best almond butter I've ever had. I love that almonds are the only ingredient in this!!,positive
Perfect on our homemade popcorn.  Easy to pour.  Fewer calories!  Score!,positive
King Arthur's All-Purpose Gluten Free flour is wonderful. I have Celiac disease and use KA brand primarily. It turns out the best. I use this flour to make GF pie crust from the recipe on their website. It is great and turns out better than their GF pie crust mix. Give it a try.,positive
These were exactly what I was hoping for. The candies themselves are individually wrapped and are perfect for taking anywhere you might go. My wife takes some of these with her for flights or long car rides.,positive
Loved it as a child. Hard to find in stores anymore. Always had it at Christmas. Put this candy out this year and everyone liked it. Was gone fast.,positive
"I LOVE THESE SANDWICHES. If people are looking for a keto answer to a fast food craving, this is it.The texture is not that far off from a McGriddle, so it’s definitely a plus to add a bit of sugar free syrup to these guys if you’re feeling extra indulgent. I heat these right before work every morning, and I couldn’t be happier with my commute now.Now the key to remember that this is healthy fast, frozen food. I still make a big, homemade breakfast on the weekend, but this most certainly hits the spot during the work week.A tip? Toaster Oven is probably the most effective way to cook these, but they’re delicious in the microwave, just don’t over-cook.",positive
Better than I thought it was going to be. I vacuum sealed some for hurricane season.,positive
"Flavor is incomparable, big enough not cheap but worth",positive
"Really like these drinks, my wife does too.",positive

I purchased this for my grandson who loves corvettes. It was a hit for his 13th birthday. It tasted good too.,positive
Received Red Bag (non-organic) instead of advertised Brown Bag (ORGANIC),negative
Awesome toppers. The kids loved them!,positive
"Qualifier - Bought outside Amazon.  But agree with everyone else, even my cats won't eat it and that is saying something.  More like pink Tuna soup; slivers of poor grade tuna vs. chunks.  Even at such a low price point, not worth the money.",negative
Excellent variety of flavors. Something for everyone in this set.,positive
got all dark chocolate and not what was in the picture of white and milk chocolate do not like dark chocolate,negative
This was used for my daughter's spa birthday party it was what i was looking for and a great price all the little girls at the party was so excited the looks on there face's was priceless..,positive
"Kind of hard to navigate between flavors and to control flow. Over priced novelty item. Makes a nice gift bag add on treat or stocking stuffer, but I prefer the original box container with a single or dual flavor set up.",negative
Awesome product but expensive price.  When you have been to Indo and see what you actually pay for this product..sticker shock.,positive
Necessary addition to the spice rack,positive
Did not seem like very much peppercorn in comparison to the large package.,positive
This is a great cereal especially if you are on a Keto diet.  It's kind of makes you feel like a kid again when eating the cream.  Fun flavors.,positive
"Truth in advertising: ""strong & intense"" is right. This is the boldest chocolate I've ever tasted. It gets right up in your face. If this were a red wine, I think you'd call it very dry. The simplest of ingredients: chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, milk fat, vanilla extract. Normally I'll eat an entire chocolate bar in one sitting without a second thought, but this chocolate invites—nay, demands—attention and care. I ate one section and I was satisfied. Wow.",positive
"The plant looks no where near the size shown on website. Measures 3x6,  description say 3.5 x16. I purchased as a gift, so I can’t return. Seller said when I messaged him, “well not all plants are the same size”. This plant is not worth $25 dollars spent.",negative

"For me, this is the best chai latte I've tried. It has a very strong spice flavor, and a very creamy texture.",positive
My favorite tea.  It is a strong tea so I can use these teabags in place of expensive tea Kcups.,positive
Hands down best chili sauce out there!,positive
The best tasting that I've had yet.,positive
Great tasting healthy tea. It has a slight tart/bitter taste but does not overwhelm the peach flavor.,positive
"So happy to find quantity that we need, yet a low price -- usually found only in the mega quantities.Love this flavor -- robust flavor, but not overwhelming harshness. Would order again!",positive
WowIt was just perfect,positive
"I was surprised to see that my package had a different nutrition label than what was shown here. I have been searching for a beef jerky brand that is acceptable on a low carb diet. What the new label clarifies, that is omitted in the picture they currently show, is that a serving size is one small piece. Problem is, it's one gram per piece. Using the induction list for Atkins, you're allowed 20 carbs (net) a day. I would blow through a whole day's allotment in one sitting. Wish I had known the facts before buying as it isn't cheap stuff.The labeling kerfuffle aside, I was pleased to realize that this stuff is genuinely made from solid pieces of meat. It's not as dry as I would have preferred, but this is (as one astute reviewer said) still a jerky lover's treat. It's good and salty, as premium jerky should be, packs a solid amount of natural protein and isn't too soft. There's a reason the serving size is small: This stuff is rich in taste and as such, you likely won't be tempted to over indulge. Plus, while it might be something of an acquired taste for some, you'll never be satisfied with the water-injected crap they pimp at gas stations.Update: I came back and added more stars because frankly, this is the best jerky I have ever had and it is ridiculously addictive. I bought three more bags, and have discovered that there is nothing about this jerky that I don't love.",positive
this is the best tasting GF pasta i've ever tried. seriously.the chickpea one is not good though. sorry.,positive
"This is really good, especially in my vegan Mac and cheese. The consistency reminds me of a block style type of cheese",positive
"UPDATE:-1 star, down from 3.I ordered the hot & spicy version this time. it's definitely a bit hot but not too hot. the problem is that there is too much spice (as compared to the plain asparagus one, which is very underspiced) -- there is absolutely no asparagus taste or aroma. I could not taste the bell pepper anywhere either, nor the garlic. the overall taste is purely red chilis, everything else gets lost. even the whole garlic clove itself tasted of mostly chili pepper, barely of garlic.I would almost give 1 star instead of 2, except both versions have that wonderful perfect crisp crunchiness.ORIGINAL REVIEW:opened the first jar today, and got some good asparagus aroma.wow-crispy! this is the kind of delicate crunchiness you aspire to, when blanching fresh asparagus.almost all of the spears are closer to baby-size, and even the few larger ones still have such a great texture!butsadly, the sugar + white-vinegar ends up being the true bland overpowering flavor here. (and some mild mustard-seed/mustard-leaf flavor. and I can't even taste the garlic... but I do have a serious temptation to eat the garlic clove at the bottom of the jar...)I wish I'd tried the spicy version instead. but this is ok, it will definitely get eaten. and, again, it is crispy in the best way.I maybe had the wrong expectation - I was looking for a sort of side condiment to rice/noodle dishes. this however would definitely make a great cocktail addition, as other reviewers have mentioned. or on a cheese/crudite plate.",negative
This product is used at work.  Have a coffee area and the majority likes the pump.,positive
These are my husband's favorite cheese snack.  I have re-ordered twice.  I love poutine and they are exactly the right size.,positive

I love this product. Tried other brands but always came back to Pepperwood. It is the best!!,positive
"What can I say, it's bacon!  For those of you who are trying to reduce carb intake this is one of the few jerky products with no carbs.  Most of the pieces are crispy, but like any cooked bacon, you can have some soft fat areas.  Cost per ounce is high and you could save money buying and cooking your own bacon, but this is very convenient and satisfying for any bacon lover.",positive
Taste just like everything bagels.  Lots of flavor.,positive
The product seemed to be fresh and had a wonderful aroma to it. It worked well in the recipes.The cardamon at the local stores was almost twice the price for the exact same brand.,positive
Great tasting tea and soothing to the digestion.,positive

Please be aware: this product can cause an addiction 😀 My favorite sunflower seeds brand!,positive
I add this salt to by tri tip and tastes just like one I get in Santa Maria.  It is the perfect blend of seasoning.,positive

"A bit pricey, but what isn’t these days..",positive
A very good gift to my son.,positive
I'm no coffee guru but I have to tell you that I've been drinking this brand for years and it's much better tasting than most others.,positive
The spiciness is just right the delicious good flavor just explodes in your mouth. You can't stop eating it. I used it with pholorie.,positive
"I have tried almost all of wondeslim snacks and I really do love them all but this one is a bummer. I know you lack texture when you add protein but this is truly hard to swollow, gross. I will not be buying these again",negative
Great stuff. Only problem is the holes on the shaker container are too small. So I just remove the lid. Not a big deal.,positive
Well packaged and clean beans,positive
My wife loves this brand of grits. Great!!!!,positive
Best salmon ever! So flavorful and fresh. Combination of seasoning on fish is extraordinary. I pop it in my toaster oven and in 15 minutes we’re ready to eat.,positive
"Cookies were inedible. Regardless of a 5 year old, 34 year old or 65 year old. None of us were able to put more then a dent in to the actual cookie for fear of damaging our teeth.",negative
"This Kirkland microwave popcorn is Very Tasty and the Reviews on Amazon were Mostly 5 STARS!Just 2 minutes in the microwave and 98& of the pop corn seeds all pop up, large and fluffy.  You will enjoy the buttery, lightly salted flavor.  Highly Recommended.  D.W.",positive
"There was no out of place taste and the instructions were easy to follow. The dark color comes from the hemp, and the preparation is a bit more like tortillas de harina rather than corn tortillas made with 3 ingredients like Maseca, but that's to be expected. Don't add too much water in the dough and you should be fine, you'll know you can stop kneading when the dough starts to pick up all the left over sticky dough on the bowl and it's clean. (Hopefully that makes sense)",positive

This is my third time ordering in packs of 3. I ordered 2 more boxes of  3 each and should have received six bags but only received 5! I would love to get the one bag that I was shorted!Love these so much expensive but worth it!Please send me my missing bag I’ll be sooooooo happy!,positive

"some may like it, I dont like the way it tastes personally. Just not for me but good value",negative
Nothing measures up to Belgian chocolate. Smooth and flavorful!,positive
This is by far the best tasting peanut butter. It is less sweet. It is very creamy. I use it to put on my Hershey Symphony blue label bars. TIP: Sometimes there is a little oil on top. Simply store the peanut butter on its side in your pantry. Open it up with it still on its side and the oil will simply pour out and the peanut butter will remain dry. Or you can store it on it's side in the refrigerator until you open it up. Then you can simply scoop it out easily with a spoon and there is no need to stir anything.,positive
"Firm, yet soft, and intensely satisfying.",positive
Good price and good expresso,positive
Yum!! A favorite from my childhood!! So glad I found it on your site!,positive

I love the flavor.  Hide these.,positive
It took me back when I was a little kid going to school. I love chick-o-sticks. Nothing like that flavor in the world.,positive
Handed these out to neighborhood kids on Halloween.  The kids were all thrilled.,positive
Popcorn is great. Fast shipping!,positive
"I was in Paris when I first tried this brand. When I came back I looked this up on Amazon and it wasn't available. I just seen this pop up on a lightening deal and I jumped at the opportunity.  All of the flavors are rich and delicious, but my favorite is Onyx, its very dark and earthy tasting. It is much cheaper than regular nespresso pods.",positive
Best Sauce ever! taco beel should have never discontinued it!,positive
Always a favorite but this shipment was hard and stale and went right in the garbage disposal...no wonder it was an add on item. Don't waste your money for stale candy.  Boxes even looked old.,negative
Nice bottle of coarse black pepper.,positive
It was open nerver got to use it was unhappy wasted my money dont buy stuff like that isnt safe,negative
"Be careful to buy,☠ it taste so bad and return no accepted.",negative
This CONSUMABLE FOOD ITEM Arrived completely open and thus not consumable. They say it can not be returned or refunded so I am stuck out of pocket for extremely expensive coffee.,negative
I bought granules and flakes from this company and they both smell horrible!! I would not recommend this product. You guys need to check the smell of this product because it is not right!,negative
Nice little package.  All was good and fresh....  kind of weird for the American Palate but the Grandbabies enjoyed the experience.  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,positive
This coffee is delicious! I stumbled upon Corner One during our search for organic coffee and decided to try it out because the price was so great. And I have to say my husband and I are thrilled to find we enjoyed this coffee just as much as our favorite organic brand.,positive
"This was a gift for my brother and his family.  Asked him about the popcorn 🍿 and said his wife liked the kettle corn,  he liked the chocolate Carmel, and niece liked it all.  He said they munched on it all weekend",positive
Not much flavor....,negative
"Too sweet, absolutely no flavor, no color, and too fizzy. Don't waste your money.",negative
Please don't buy this if you are allergic to shellfish. It's not worth the risk.,negative
Bought these for baking but that didn’t happen.  My daughter and I finished them before I could find a recipe.  I remember getting these in my stocking at Christmas one year when I was younger.  Still delicious.,positive
"Twinings English Breakfast tea is my favorite!  I cannot stand the teas made in the US.  They are weak and do not taste right.  However, Twinings is now in the US but have the same recipe as made in England.  My all time favorite black tea!!!!",positive
"Good flavor, fair price, but very strong. I like strong coffee and while the flavor isn't extremely ""bold"" per se, the caffeine intake feels very strong. I've enjoyed the coffee and the flavor. If caffeine gives you the jitters in high dosage then maybe try a less caffeinated brand.",positive
"THE CHOCOLATE COATING ON THE NUT WAS GOOD, BUT THE NUTS WHERE STALE, TASTED OLD.WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.",negative
The taste is amazing. Rich and smooth.,positive
I purchased this cake topper for my wedding. It fit perfect on top of the cake and look so cute. The only thing I would say is it's very delicate so store in a safe place until the wedding. Well worth the price.,positive
"I had purchased this because we had just read my granddaughter ""The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe"". None of us had the regular Turkish delight, so we were curious. I think Baby Girl is as addicted to it as Edmund. It tastes like marshmallows. The only problem is I can only have one once in a while. I would definitely recommend this.",positive
I used this for my face mask and it’s been helping a lot. I love the quantity I received for the price paid. Would definitely order this again,positive
"Great flavor, balance between heat and ginger",positive
"Let me start off by saying that this is high quality rosemary. I love the fact that is organic, and it is fresh. Rosemary is a sort of bitter herb, but it's bursting with unique flavor. It's perfect for adding flavor to cooking. I enjoy adding it to soups and plant based meats. You can also use this versatile herb to make teas. It has health benefits, such as boosting the immune system, reducing inflammation and decreasing stress. It makes an old fashioned remedy for illnesses such as the flu. As with any herb, do some research before you add rosemary to your diet. Highly recommend trying!",positive
"If you love intense coffee flavors, this would be a great sample variety pack to learn various VertuoLine capsules.",positive
"I live on this. Very nice, rich flavor.",positive
Traveled here a few years ago.  Wonderful country in Central American and wonderful people.  Worth a visit to tour this coffee plantation. It's great we can get this coffee on Amazon.,positive
I have ordered these many times. I like to have them on hand. They are quick and delicious. Love that I can use different pie fillings.....think apple is my favorite!,positive
Bought for a friend and she loves them!,positive
"I have tried a number of mackerel and this always remains my favorite.  Excellent quality, no waste, taste is fantastic.",positive
"My husband has a history of kidney stones and was drinking black tea, so we switched to white tea for his health. Of course white tea can be very expensive, so we tried a couple and shopped around. The price on this has fluctuated from my last purchase to current purchase by several dollars. The first time I purchased it as an ""add-on"" item for $6.63 and one month later it was over ten dollars, so I am not too happy about that.The tea itself is mildly floral and tastes great. We love that the tea bags are natural and not chemically bleached. The tea itself is free from pesticides and the description says that it is, ""grown in the mountains of the Fujian Province of China and undergoes little processing."" Compared to the reviews that I read about a comparable brand, Prince of Peace which is sold at my local store, this tea has a superior taste.",positive
The flavor is great and our favorite.I have only had one box in the past that was a little bitter.,positive
These were awful.  Hard as a rock and tasted awful.  Had to throw them away.,negative
sour. love it,positive
they were chipped and broken and there was a lot of crumbs at the bottom of the bag.,negative
Fabulous Tea! This is my go-to tea for a relaxing and pick-me-up afternoon.  Love it...,positive

"Very Good Coffee, Great Taste",positive
"Very bright colors, great quality",positive
"I think these are the perfect size, texture and taste.  I wish there were more flavors, but that's only because I like those so much and wish they'd just have more variety.  I will definitely be buying these again in the future.",positive
My daughter loves chocolate milk so I love that this has added calcium.,positive

Excellent for protein.  I eat it by the spoonful.,positive

"Absolutely love this stuff , Highly recommend to everyone who loves ice coffee",positive
It works for improving the production.,positive
This was put in a bubble envelope.  The entire bag of chips were crushed into tiny pieces.,negative
"I got the ginger flavored incarnation of this tea and it rocks.  Amazon sent me an invitation to rate the ginger, but pasted my review onto the plain flavor, which I am sure is as fine as the ginger quality-wise.  If you can find it, try out the ginger.  The ginger is mild but has a lot of depth and staying power.  In my diet, I have promoted it from a beverage to a treat!  I like to add a tiny drop of lemon flavored stevia.  Last I looked, Amazon was out of this item.  It's sooo good, I would even look elsewhere to find it.",positive
Amazing product!! Tastes great too!!,positive
Great coffee and yummy hazelnut flavor,positive
Nasty tasting. Would not ever buy again. Waste of money.,negative
"I would order this item again. Just right for lunches. I give 5 stars for Portion, Flavor and Freshness.",positive
Like and enjoy all of my items purchased,positive
This my favorite microwave popcorn and I can’t find the homestyle like I used to. I received my box of popcorn very quickly and in perfect shape. It’s not stale and popped just fine.  One more thing to snack on while hiding out at home. I recommend.,positive
Good smoke flavor and taste good on everything that I cooked.,positive
Made a Halloween pasta salad with these and it turned out perfect. They held their shape and were really yummy. I would buy these again!,positive
Cans were received severely dented on tops and bottoms.,negative
I am so glad my husband found these drinks since they took away the G2.,positive
"I bought this because I eat in Ruby Tuesday and always get one of their berry ice teas or lemonades, which I adore. I finally asked them what they put in it and they showed me this. I was thrilled to find it on amazon and not too expensive. I bought wild berry but will get the strawberry too. I keep mine in the fridge after opening and it lasts quite a long time. Tastes homemade, like you made your own berry syrup. I’m trying it over cheesecake next!  I also like that it doesn’t have a ton of chemicals in it. Absolutely delicious stuff! In case someone wonders how long it lasts, when I called the company they told me 90-180 days",positive
"@_xotashhh I love having days off school, I had one on friday too",positive
"these rice cakes are delicious and cook easily. Holds the flavors of sauces great. The texture is very pleasant, not as chewy as others are.",positive

Was resealable,positive
Nothing like getting this and 2/3 expire in 3 days and one was already expired,negative
We used to buy this religiously at Costco but since dropping our membership we struggled to find a replacement. You'd think finding good whole bean coffee at a reasonable price wouldn't be hard but it's quite the challenge. After weeks of searching locally the Amazon Prime light flickered on in my head & I was relieved to find Mayorga here! And it's a great price! Yasssss!!!,positive
My wife and I love this coffee and were buying several at a time but the price has doubled in the last few weeks........what's up with that.  $9.99 for 11 oz is just too expensive for our taste!,positive
"It's satisfactory , price could be lower",positive
"Gave this as a gift to my mother and she states this is so good it is like ""angels kissing your tongue"".",positive
"When garnishing or seasoning with melted butter this stuff is the best.  Also, it needs no refrigeration.  For Fresh boiled or steamed Maine Lobster this stuff is a requirement. If you like melted butter on your popcorn, this stuff is a requirement.!",positive
These are indispensable for meeting my daily protein requirements. The flavor is great for a ready to drink protein shake. The price is high but the convenience factor makes it worth it. I'm starting to see muscle gains for the first time in my life and will keep buying more.,positive
"Exactly what I'm missing from Chicago, it's great I can get it delivered.I probably order 1 every 2 months it's that good.",positive
"Wrong item, not as advertised, wanted salad flavor, should have read other reviews about seller.",negative
"We are avid drinkers of Bustelo ground coffee at home and was going on a trip where there was not going to be a coffeemaker available. Discovered these and they are so good! Has a little sweeter kick to it (typical with instant), but that’s fine with me! Had to go through about 3 packets per person each time, but if you’re just looking for a little pick-me-up in the mornings, 1-2 packets should suffice. Package says 1 packet to every 6oz, but we did 1 to every 4oz.",positive
I wanted to keep some extra food in the house if I was short on cash and low on food.  Good thing.  These were actually really good.  Very flavorful and a really good deal.,positive
Paid for a variety pack and only got one flavor total rip off,negative
Taste terrible and I love mango but this tastes bad,negative
Taste great and is good for you!,positive
Great sweet treat!,positive
"This is my favorite Muesli, except for making it myself of course. I cannot pretend to give a hoot and a holler for people's expectation of Omega 6 vs. Omega 3 fatty acids. I think eating healthy is important; meanwhile I think over-analyzing food is ludicrous. It's a good cereal. I actually eat it plain everyday as my snack. I'm a teacher... it's not the easiest to just eat plain, but it has a very pleasant combination of flavors, such that I don't need to add anything to it. Occasionally I will add nuts... because I like nuts... not because they add Omega blah blah blah... ya know, seriously, I cannot imagine people over-analyzing their food like some of these comments...It doesn't have an over-abundance of dried fruits either. It is a good combination of all the ingredients such that each mouthful is pretty much the same throughout the whole bag.",positive
My favorite almond flavor yet! They need bulk size in this flavor!,positive
All of these sauces are delicious.  I serve them all the time to guests and they never suspect that they're sugar free. So convenient to have on hand for last minute meals also.,positive
We like this coffee and it is def priced well for quality. But it is roasted a little dark for breakfast blend.,positive
The order was processed quickly and the product arrived very promptly.  I like the pouches that it comes in and they are useful after they are opened.  Thanks for your wonderful product.,positive
This box wasn't as bad as the other box I received with chips in it.  I enjoy the pop corn and is just the right quanity for one sitting.,positive
Disliked it because it turned my poop blue,negative
"This is the best tuna fish I have ever had. I have it delivered every three months. A little more expensive than the usual, but oh-so-good.",positive
I ordered three bags and all  of them were crumbled upon arrival.,negative

Love this pizza sauce and one can is the perfect amount for a pizza. No waste!My brother owns a pizza shop and it's the brand they use. Delicious!,positive
Great product I previously used another product and I find this is equally tasteful and  I'm very pleased with this product.,positive
These chips are stale and I want a refund,negative
Gave as a gift for road trip. Nothing was expired or even close to expiring. Nothing was crumbled or broken during shipping. Good variety.,positive
I used the product every morning to start my day.,positive
Twinings of London Chai Tea Bags has a great taste.  I have bought numerous name brands over the years.  This is by far the best tasting Chai tea I have purchased.  Full bodied flavor with just one tea bag in a 6 or 8 oz. cup.  I will definitely stick with it.,positive
Bought as a treat for a trip and everyone said they were the best salted caramels ever.,positive
"My wife and I both love rooibos but this is, of course, a personal thing.  The point of my review is that the price of 6 boxes (120 bags) from Amazon is less than 1/2 the cost at Whole Foods, with no sales tax and no gas cost.  Just a super deal!",positive
Great sauce. Not for the faint. Great flavor and super hot.,positive
Made good nondairy yogurt,positive
"These were fantastic! I bought them as a gift for my wife, but I tried them first to see if they were any good.... I only gave her half the box :) so good.",positive
"Bait & switch.  The blueberry tea, as shown in the picture, is excellent and has been a favourite of mine for a year or so.  Unfortunately, only one of the five boxes ordered was this original formulation.  The other four were a very-much substandard formulation [with a box depicting a river-running bear.  Custsy, but no cigar!]  I am doggedly trying out the new version, but the first four packets were wildly different from each other, and not a single one was worthy of the original blend.  Two cups went down the drain after a few tastes.  The others ranged from weak to innocuous.  I'll contact Celestial once I've worked my way through a box.  The other three boxes go to the homeless food collection.",negative
"You'd be better off with any other hot sauce, this isn't good.",negative
All went well. Thanks. Grandson likes them and shares them with his baseball team.,positive
These taste fine and are good to use for a variety of recipes.  I like to add them to any sauce  to give it a real tomato taste.,positive
I did not like the taste and the spice was too heavy.,negative
Great taste & variety! Exactly what was promised.,positive
This is my son's favorite cereal (from his childhood).  He loves it.  I only wish it could be found locally.  I have to search for it every year.,positive
"I know i loved this movie when i was 12-14 years old. Now that i am 24 i watched it again, and i wished i hadn't. Because all the things i laughed at when i was younger, is no longer funny. so this is an hour and a half without fun. For me the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish. So the same thing i loved about the movie when i was a kid, is now the things i don't like about it. Besides not being funny it is not actually believable at all. The evil character is very poorly done but i guess that is the kind of movie it is. And the last 20 minutes of the movie is pretty lame with bad fighting sequences and so on... But if you are young you will probably love it. I rate this movie 4/10",negative
Gluten free products can have a odorous effect on my spouse but does fine for me. Sadly I am not the one who needs a gluten free diet . We are close to a cure for his intolerance so he may enjoy this more in the future.,positive
"Tastes really bad, mostly oily and kind of sour flavor with almost imperceptible hazelnut and chocolate flavor. Not sure if I got a bad one or it is it's normal.",negative
"I really thought I was buying an extremely lower amount of salt.  Also, grinds too small in a grinder.",negative
This coffee has become my favorite.  It is very light and tastes so good and I don't have to worry that Im going to stay up all night since its decaf.  This is one of the best coffees I have tasted and I will continue to order it.  Delivery is excellent and always comes very well packaged and in excellent condition.,positive
Boxes squashed.,negative
This is some of the best flour I have ever purchased!!,positive
When I opened the box I saw the mayonnaise was leaking out under the jar top. I don't want to be poisoned so I am not taking a chance on it. I see they won't accept a return. I paid over $11 for this single jar. I am extremely disappointed in Amazon for this. A total waste!,negative
The flavor was disgusting.. how can that uplift my mood to begin with?!,negative
"light,crispy and really tasty. these are terrific!",positive
I’ve tried to contact the company for a refund. My bag had a huge slice in it. Like a razor knife would make. So I didn’t eat them.,negative
These are delicious BUT EVERY SINGLE BOX IS BROKEN INTO A MILLION PIECES OF TINY CRACKER. Pretty ridiculous.,negative
"These are so good. Texture-wise, they are more like a cross between a muffin and a scone though.",positive
Delicious just what you’d expect !,positive
Nice product. tasty!,positive
I've ordered several turmeric brands and this rates as one of the best. Highly recommend.,positive
I see a lot of bad reviews. I'm no lobster bisque snob. All I can say is that I enjoyed it very much. : ) I have bought it a few times.,positive
I use this teriyaki sauce when I barbecue salmon.  Friends ask me to always make it when they visit.  This teriyaki sauce is absolutely different from the standard ones.  I also use it on tenderloins (barbecue those too) cut them up to bite size pieces and add to pasta with veggies.I keep several bottles so I never run out.,positive
Always fresh and delicious :),positive
Write the date the coffee was roasted,positive
Not a cheap mix overwhelmed with peanuts.  Fresh fresh taste.,positive
Perfect on grilled corn on the cobb.,positive
"This has been my favorite coffee for many years: great flavor and body though decaf, plus a very convenient filter pack system. Glad that Amazon still offers it, as opposed to most grocery stores in my area",positive
I SWITCHED FROM ANOTHER BRAND AND I LOVE THIS COFFEE.  GREAT FLAVORS AND THE PODS HAVE NEVER LEAKS ON MY COFFEE MAKER. THANKS,positive
"This is the best, most authentic, cola you can get on amazon, i tried them all. It is worth pointing out, this does not taste like coke or pepsi, but perhaps it may remind you of RC, since RC cola is also one of the most authentic tasting of the colas.The flavor is strong, maybe too strong for people who don't care for the taste of cola, but I am guessing most of you do like it or you wouldn't be buying this :) The taste is very spiced, almost woody, but very well balanced with the sweetness. If you are mixing it in a 1 liter soda stream bottle, mix in 6 ounces. A little under 6 ounces if you are brave enough to premix.",positive
"Loved the taste,  my new favorite,",positive
"I bought these thinking they were going to be the green tender kind similar to the pictures I saw from others. The beans I got are brown and very old looking, taste old and flavorless. I was hoping for the green kind. The worse part is that I can’t even return them. There goes the $30 I spent, to the garbage. Obviously there us No consistency on the product. I will never buy these again!Update: I contacted seller, they said they will refund my money.",negative
This is a versatile seasoning and now is available in plastic where it is easier to dispense and you can see how much is remaining. We love this.,positive
"They have been hard for me to find. My local Walmart used to stock them, but eventually started stocking a different flavor. Not too spicy and very authentic tasting. Definitely better than Nissan and Maruchan, and also worth the money.",positive
"I can’t say it’s a bad product since it’s a matter of taste.  But, this was pretty horrific tasting.",negative
Love the starts. Easy to grow and beautiful!,positive
I use this to make gelatin snacks for my old pup to help with joint stiffness. Approximately 4:1 ratio of gelatin powder to no-salt chicken or beef broth I've heated up to a simmer. I mix it in the blender on low speed for a couple minutes to make sure there are no clumps and then put it back in the pot and into the fridge to set up for a few hours. Cut into bite-size pieces and keep in an air-tight container in the fridge until it's treat time.These are also handy for adding to soups and sauces for humans.,positive
These are great for adding a bit of heat and great flavor to my stir fry dishes.  Easy to control the heat level based on qty used.  If you don't like a lot of heat just use one or two.,positive
"These are by far the most convenient electrolytes for travel or on the go. I can now avoid spilling powder from electrolyte packets everywhere and just put a few drops in a cold water bottle instead. Definitely recommend these or any type of electrolytes in ice cold water for the best flavor. I got the variety pack and ended up liking fruit punch the most! Nice to try out a few to see which I would reorder. Great product for travel, the gym, or to keep handy in the car.",positive
Clean taste!,positive
I love these teas but i ordered it 4 times and 3 of the times i was delivered the wrong flavor.  If they can not send you what you order then it is useless and also a large waste of money.,negative
Very Tasty!  Perfect on low carb eating plan,positive
What’s a better surprise than a fortune cookie filled with a scripture verse?  My small group and I had a blast with this idea!,positive
Sent this to my sister in law for her birthday..she absolutely LOVED IT!,positive

The lime is the only one that tastes ok.  The other two really don't taste good at all.  I tried returning these but they won't take them back.  What a waste..,negative

"This movie was one of the best I have ever seen. Just the other day I was reminded of this movie by something on TV. It came back to me like a dam flooding over. I have never been more touched by a movie than by this one. After the movie was over I actually could not quit crying for about 2 hours. No movie has ever moved me that way before. I was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen it since but am hoping I can find a copy to buy so that I can watch it whenever I want to. If someone suggests you see this movie with them, GO....you will not be disappointed.Peggy Fries",positive
"Perfect for tomatoes, salads, marinades. All flavors taste great!",positive
"This Coconut oil is so smooth and tasty.  I love it.  I use it in lotions that I make, to cook with and also in Bullet Proof coffee every morning.  And of course for oil pulling.  This is one of the best I have found so far!",positive
"I've enjoyed matcha tea many times over the years, including in the formal Japanese tea ceremony. This tea is perfect for that with a rich taste. For hot tea it's best to use the proper matcha tea accessories, like the bamboo whisk and scoop. I started drinking iced matcha tea and this tea works well for that. First make regular hot tea then add ice. The recipes for matcha ice cream, cake and smoothies look worth a try, too.",positive
Coffee. The best,positive
The kalamata are delicious,positive
"I usually buy the more expensive brand and was a little apprehensive about this one being so much cheaper.  However, the cats don't seem to be able to tell the difference and they're really enjoying it",positive
Worked very well. Good product!,positive
I was delightfully surprised at the flavor and how soft these berries are.  I add them to many things and eat them on their own like raisons. I've had others and been disappointed at how dry and tasteless they can be.,positive
"nice selection of different teas, liked them all so far.",positive
"I bought this flavor with the other two flavors, I love them all!",positive
"What you get is NOT what was pictured. Seller denied a refund or return & claimed it was the manufacturer's fault, but other vendors are selling the legit box with Skittles without issue. This pack does NOT contain Skittles or 3 Musketeers. RIP OFF- do not buy!!",negative
Just the right size for storing on the freezer door. Used to feed sourdough starter and will last for quite a while.,positive
Just received the order and I noticed the box was damp.  Upon opening I noticed all the contents were wet.  4 cans had been damaged and leaked.  I will never order this again. I truly enjoy the taste of this soda but it does not do well in shipping.,negative
Perfect for little kids!,positive
"$8 and it looks like this?  It could had be the exception and got the bad batch, however it is guaranteed freshness!  Next time I hope they consider not to send them like that and apply credit to account, we won’t touch the grapes, and will be tossing them out.",negative
"Love this stuff!!!!!!  After freezing it, I let it thaw a little and have frozen yogurt!  Yummy!",positive
Was looking for nice holiday gifts - this was perfect to send via amazon over the holidays!!,positive
I love the crunchy salty combination of these wrapped cashews. Being in their shell adds an additional flavor profile that truly sets these apart from any other cashews you could buy. I'm so glad I discovered them but sadly since discovering them they haven't been in stock which makes me think they were discontinued.,positive

This is 1 of the only 2 brands of cereal I eat.,positive
surprised it's so good when it's this inexpensive,positive
Taste like stove top brewed tea.,positive
love it had movie night it was a hit on the popcorn,positive
"I love the taste of it. It's a spanish christmas candy (just like peanut brittle in the US) made with almonds. For those who may have issue chewing, if is to hard for you, get a right portion bite size and leave it in the mouth to soften & more flavor. I have had this since I was a child and now that im in the US is dificult to find this but now that I can get it here, I'm able to share my traditions with friends. As well this brand has a better taste than others I have tried. I recommend it to anyone.",positive
I love Twinnings teas. They have been making their product for over 300 years and practice makes perfect. I enjoy earl grey teas and this is such a delightful and light variation on the usual earl greys that it is a must for tea totalers,positive
"These are wonderful Tootsie Pops; cannot find them in a retail store, so rather unique for home consumption.",positive
I read all the reviews and thought maybe it is better now. IT IS NOT!  The oil with the olives ruins everything. Cannot add to a drink without that slimy film on your lips. Worse is that many of the olives still have seeds. Gross! Never again. Keep your damn olives in Greece. YUCK!!,negative
The filling was tasty if not a bit too sweet. But I didn’t really mind the sweetness. The problem was the crust. The bottom crust was very undercooked and soggy. It ruined the pie.  I bought a half pie. So I couldn’t put it in the oven to finish baking the crust. The pie sat around for a few days and no one really wanted it. Then I checked it and all the bottom crust went moldy. I do not recommend unless you are in the store and can see the doneness of the crust. I unfortunately had my groceries delivered and got what I got. But the store should had cooked it properly. Raw dough is inedible.,negative
exactly what you would expect...good value,positive
There was more than I expected and was able to divide up around my place. Smells great.,positive
I used this to make traditional tiramisu and it tasted just like the tiramisu I eat at restaurants. The cookie was extremely absorbent and only required a one second dip for it to moisten up. I love this product and would buy again!,positive
"Delivered exactly as expected (on time and package was undamaged). It tastes the same as regular table salt so I didn't have to adjust to the flavor. If it really is better for me than regular salt (Morton's, grocery store generic, etc) then great. I like the idea that it doesn't have the additives. I usually drink some before bed to keep from having leg and foot cramps and it is working.",positive
Very tasty! A great gift!,positive
Bottle shattered upon delivery and leaked all over my front porch... thanks for being completely useless and a waste of money,negative
Loose sugar packets in a mailer. No box. Tacky.,negative
"I can absolutely appreciate that this is a small, family owned business. The packaging was beautiful. Presentation lovely. The note inside thank Ming me for my business was a nice touch but the cupcakes were mini cupcakes. It was not worth the price I paid. My recipients are young adults and they were just happy to receive something nice for Valentine’s Day but I was mortified by the size of what they received and was totally disappointed, being the gift giver. I ordered for 5 different recipients. Unfortunately I won’t be ordering again.",negative
This is the second year of giving Hawaiian Host for gifts.  They LOVE them!  Thank you for being so prompt with delivery.  Next year I will probably have to double the order.  Thanks again!,positive
"I love the flavor of this coffee, I thought I could only find it in Europe,  I started looking on the web ty see if I could find it. I think I was so excited I just went ahead and order it. I was so disappointed because the grind are to big for espresso or cap. Can anyone tell me where can I find costs coffee for my espresso machine please? Thank you. BTW that was the only setback otherwise everything is great.",negative
Good treat with good taste,positive
"I add this to my cream soups, omelettes, steaks, etc.the aroma is strong, I could smell the truffle before even opening the container.",positive
They arrive from Pantry in a box with heavier items & no cardboard divider.They act as padding for everything else in the box.You wind up getting a bag of Doritos flavored seasoning crumbs that still taste great as salad and pizza toppings.But not chips.,negative
"These are my favorite, they arrived quickly, however, they were not fresh.",negative
Loved it and the size.  Will surely buy again.,positive
Like the container use them in salads,positive
"My family and I love the Fiber One snacks.  The brownies, the cinnamon coffee cakes, and the chocolate chip cookies are considered real treats at my house.  I bought these expecting something just as good, but I was disappointed.  There's just a minimal amount of fruit/jelly on these things that does nothing to satisfy my cravings.  My kids feel the same way, so I've got one open box just sitting in the pantry and another box in storage.  I think the Fiber One line is great overall, but I recommend passing on these.",negative
Bet dark chocolate out there!,positive
"This one's the same as peanut butter, but it's made from almonds. Every other almond butter I've tried is oily and tasteless; it's as if the almonds aren't being roasted, just ground  up. Barney Butter's the one to get!",positive
These were perfect for our office and for our home. Sadly everybody ate them way too fast. LOL!,positive
"I bought Fisher roasted sunflower seeds like this a few months ago. They were small and inadequately roasted, but I roasted them myself and they were marginally okay. The price was right so I was willing to put up with the just-okay taste and size and having to re-roast them myself.I re-ordered them recently and they were the same small size and only lightly roasted, but this time they were also rancid. I tried roasting them to see if that would help, but it did not. I ended up with was better-roasted rancid sunflower seeds. So I have five pounds of sunflower seeds I will not be able to eat. I will not order this product again. I am getting leery about ordering edible products from A*m*a*zon.",negative
"Great, lo calorie, crispy and delicious and healthy!  Yum I use for sandwiches now, no more salt, sugar preservatives of bread!  Only ingredients are whole wheat,  wheat bran and water! Has fiber other matzos lack!",positive
"We don't have fry sauce in the South so it was a pleasant surprise to find it again! Tastes as good as I remember! Also, I've never had this brand and it did not disappoint",positive
This brand makes some of my favorite tamales and the squash tamales is one of their best.,positive
Used on some lamb and it was fantastic.,positive
"This is by far my most favorite🧡🧡flavor out of all the flavors of this juice. The peachy 🍑 mangoey🥭 combo meshes together on your taste buds to cause such a satisfying party in your mouth!! You will be hooked off the 1st taste. No lie! Lol😂 Anndd its also healthy not fattening and packed with lots of vitamins for the body! Soo stop hesitating, buy it and treat yourself!! You won't be disappointed..Be Blessed😇 Jesus 💜 you!! (But you can get it a lil cheaper at Walmart tho).",positive
So wonderful in my home-made paleo granola!  Will use all the time!,positive
I have tried many of the Monster Flavors and while most of them are good the Mule is in another category by itself and leaves all other flavors behind.,positive
Crunchy and spicy but not too spicy.  Great snack,positive
"Very hard tI find right now. Not cheap, but they are the best for making dolmas. I have bought other brands in the past that were chewy and with many broken leaves. These are awesome!",positive
"These are really great snacks for anytime!  I just wish they weren't so hard to find. I first found them at Costco, but they don't carry them anymore :(  They're so worth it!",positive
I bought these cookies as a gift for a friend. I recently enjoyed tea and some of the cookies with her.  I was impressed with the packing of the cookies preventing broken ones. Ginger is a favorite flavor and these cookies satisfied that flavor. They are crisp and delicious.,positive
So the actual flamingo is heavier than we thought it was. It still sat on the cake really well but if had dropped it would have broken easily. It's durable but heavy. It made for a good cake topper but I would suggest getting it for maybe a half sheet or round cake. I got a full sheet and it was a bit small but still so cute.,positive
"A little bland. Also best is to boil the noodles separately for on the broth and shock them in cold water to prevent further cooking, otherwise wise they get too soggy and sticky.",negative
Delightful. Will purchase again.,positive
"Safety seal popped, pickles not fresh, just mushy. Have had many types of bread and butter pickles, these should stay in Pittsburgh though!",negative
Creamy and not too sweet,positive
"I liked the variety of flavors, didn't come melted, and worked perfect for stuffing Easter eggs.",positive
Loved the freshness of the flowers.,positive
It is hard and the flavor is gone in 3 chews! Total rip off!,negative
Ordered this one by mistake! Bad taste and yucky!,negative

Arrived intact and undamaged.  Delicious product!,positive
"Many years ago I found a coffee shop while vacationing in Santa Cruz, California that had the best American type coffee I have ever had. I would get up early in the morning and walk down to this shop and get a large ""to go"" cup (usually the first cup of the day he sold) and go sit on the quiet beach and savor it. I would go out of my way to get his coffee if I was traveling. He made his own blend and ground it onsite and would only sell coffee that had been brewed no more than 1 hour (he actually never had to waste much coffee). When my wife convinced me to order this coffee on Amazon I had no idea that it would bring back all those wonderful memories every time I drink a cup. It's that good. Once opened, we keep it in a special container in the frig to keep it fresh. …. Gee. Think I'll go down and make a cup right now. Bye. (Oh, and buy!)",positive
5oz bag would b better. But still amazing jerky very happy with purchase. Thank you for a great product. Just as described,positive
"super, super, super....you can eat in one sitting...",positive

This one finally come with a shipping box and not wet. The taste is good. Both of my dad and my brother love it. I would definitely order more.,positive
the flavor was everything. i couldn’t stop eating them,positive
"I am very glad to find this on Amazon, since it is seldom in stock in the US - and I used it regularly in London. It is a wonderful relish for sandwiches and cheese.",positive
"The Tea and Lemonade is the best flavor to me but it's so hard to find now. I was wondering if it's about to be discontinued......or if it's that popular. The taste is smooth, not overly sweet and close to homemade.",positive
"best of both worlds, sweet and salty!",positive
"There is more in this bag than we were really ready to use up, but as a means to see how it can be used we've  let ourselves go a bit crazy with it and add it to just about everything just to see what happens. We started easy, adding it to stuff like jams and sauces and meat dishes as a seasoning just to make sure we liked the base effect it had on flavor, and once we knew that all three of us in the household weren't grossed out by the acidic kick it can give to things, we started branching out and adding pinches and teaspoons to things like guacamole, salsas, curries, smoothies, teas, and (for the adults) cocktails.This stuff has a level of utility we weren't expecting, but it's been fun to experiment.***Storage***As it became clear how long it was going to take for us to use all of this, we portioned off about half the bag into an airtight secondary container so it doesn't get clumpy if we haven't used the first half of the bag before springs. It's a lot of citric acid and we're still figuring out our favorite uses so we didn't want it getting ruined as we transition to spring and humidity creeps back into our lives over the next month and a half.***Overall Value***If you don't do a lot of lemon-themed baking or sour candy making, this bag will last you a while. If we did more of those two things we'd probably have worked our way through more of this bag by now. There's a lot in this bag and for $14 (at the time of this review) that's a LOT of citric acid to use up across a lot of meals/baking projects/etc.",positive
"I like Matcha, and this is the best that I have tried.. and the tin is cute",positive
I’m a Espresso type of girl. I found that ordering through Amazon would be faster shipping. Everything was legit. Delivery was super fast. I received these pods the next day.,positive
I've ordered from this company several times now and they never disappoint! I was excited to see a larger multi- serving bag of Nova Chips included in this box ! I highly recommend this product. and I love the company's Lift Hire Program that creates employment for individuals with special needs. such a great way to use your platform to help others.🖤,positive
Convenient and full of flavor we use this every day in our shake. Very tasty.,positive
I love the chip I wish there were more in the bag,positive
"For a 2-person family, the 10.5 oz. of Progresso Seafood, White Clam Sauce is the perfect size.  You cannot find this in any store in Houston anymore.  I ordered several cases to have on hand.  Great to have for a quickly prepared hot pasta dinner!!!!",positive
"The product arrived with the lid seal broken and slightly ajar. I didn't feel safe eating it. However, I couldn't return it because it is not returnable.",negative
"This was the first coffee and chicory I've tried. I really like it. I only decided to but it for the antioxidants, but I enjoy it. I just drink it the same I took my coffee. It really just tastes like strong coffee.",positive

"My husband loves these and so do my kiddos and I! They are the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. They make your fingers a little messy, but who cares? I don't lol for those who can't handle a little heat I wouldn't recommend these",positive
Delivered on time.. Great product but I wish they made half caff in mild flavor,positive
"Please stop the orders, I got more than enough of this coffee, I have tried to cancel my subscription and it’s not finder friendly",positive
Been looking for these everywhere!!!  Yummy!,positive
This is my new favorite coffee and I love that it shows up at my door every month!,positive
Can only get in California. Doesn't have the bad artificial stuff like Clamato,positive
Product is delicious! Disappointed that you Amazon would ship a bulk order that expires soon. Not cool.,positive
My favorite chocolate of all times. So happy to find it here for such a low price.Milk and white chocolate flavor is the best of all. But they all very delicious.,positive
"It tastes not too sweet, this is actually a good point for my taste.Compare to other fruit bowls, the orange is actually my favorite.After Subscribe & Save, price is actually not worse than stores' price.Free shipping , expiration date are good.However, price is not stable, so Subscribe & Save needs your attention for final checking",positive
"As other reviewers said, there is a very light amount of dust on the top of the bottles, but it is just paper cardboard dust from the box & the divider which protects the bottles in transit.  It easily wipes off with a napkin  and all the bottles are hermetically sealed - so I don't understand the drama & trauma it appears to have caused other reviewers.Considering the heaviness of these items and therefore, shipping costs,  I am actually really surprised that Amazon decided to do a beverage sample pack - but glad they did.  I hope they do a juice one too!I had to add a bit of sugar to the Honest unsweet peach tea, because I like my teas to be sweet - I'm glad the credit will work for the regular Honest sweet peach tea.",positive
I was so excited to find the orange cake mix when I was a child that was the cake I would ask for my birthday.If you want a refreshing cake you can’t beat the orange cake.,positive

Misleading pictures.  You don’t get everything shown.  It says returnable but when I tried it said ineligible for return.  Item was not even opened.  DO NOT Buy!,negative
"Absolutely amazing. I wish I would have bought 2 packs. The flavors taste great, the spice is just right. It tastes even better the next day.",positive
"Product was 100% unuseable.  This was either degraded sucralose, or something completely different.Bought this instead of Splenda....and had to immediately buy Splenda (now over budget for month).Replacement was sent, and is white, sweet, and has no bitter taste.  MY ISSUE is that the seal was never closed and grey ""sucralose"" was easily seen when I opened the package.  It was CLEAR the package was not sealed correctly and should have never been sent.  To me it's the same as sending a can of food that has been punctured and is clearly laden with Clostridium botulinum (botulism).What was sent should NEVER have made it into my order.",negative
The bottle I was sent expires this month.,negative
I did not get the 5 flavors I thought I was ordering. Would not order again if I have no say in the flavors I receive.,negative
I just received a new Keurig and have tried a couple of different K-Cup varieties. I just have to say that for a smooth cup of plain deliciousness this is one of my top picks!,positive

I drink these atleast 5 times a day the price is great! I will be ordering atleast once a month.,positive
"I like unsweetened ice tea always available in the fridge with fresh slices of lemon, the large tea bags allow me to always have a gallon chilled and ready to serve, I Love strong tea so I use 2 bags to a gallon and I suggest after you open the box of tea bags store them in a air tight container to maintain freshness",positive

I will not buy these again. I couldn't even eat them most of the cashews look like they have been sitting in a warehouse for a while they were dark and they didn't taste good. From now on I will buy the whole cashews and not halves and pieces,negative
This organic green tea is so fresh and full of flavor.I drink it every morning and will definitely buy this tea again! Highly recommend it.,positive
This is NOT peach tea. I suspect there was a mixup at the factory. I have two boxes of this stuff which I suspect are probably raspberry.I will not be ordering this tea again.,negative
Was delivered quickly I’m very happy with the product.,positive
"I started my mom on Tea Forte about a year ago we have now hit obsession level, professional help is needed. This tea is unlike anything she has ever had. The flavors are so intense and full bodied. Absolutely wonderful tea (especially when made in a Brown Betty)",positive
Love the product but unfortunately I had damaged containers every single time!!  The seller did replace the product but after 2 more deliveries of damaged product I decided to start making my own.  I now realize how easy it is to make myself and no longer buy this product.,negative
Nice chocolate drink.  Wonderful flavor !! Healthy.,positive

Great tasting and easy to use with my chocolate fountain.,positive
Optimal tea. Excellent delivery.,positive
PERFECT!,positive
"Both my wife and I are big fans of this tea.  First tried it hot, and it was great.  Has a nice fruity taste that pairs well with the green tea.  I did add a bit of sweetener, but it was good without.  Later I tried it as iced tea, and it was also great.  To me this tastes like the kind of tea that you would get from a tea/coffee house - high end kind of product.",positive
"My wife prefers Earl Grey tea based on rooibos rather than black tea.  This is the third brand we've tried.  The first was wonderful for a few years, then they changed their formula and we did not like it. The second was very good, but they added orange peels, which made the tea taste a bit like orange soda once it was sweetened. Of the three we like the flavor of this brand the best.  It's also significantly less expensive than some of the other brands on the market, so we like that too.In case you're interested, here's the way my wife likes it to be made:  steep 1 teaspoon of tea in 200 degree F water in a 12 oz mug for five minutes, then dissolve in 1 tablespoon of wildflower honey, then stir in 1 tablespoon of soymilk.  The flavor of honey you use will make a difference so you may have to experiment, and we like the flavor of soymilk (in THIS tea) better than cream or milk.",positive
"I saw reviews that said crackers arrived crushed, but I thought maybe after receiving those complaints, that the problem would be resolved by now. I love the crackers and have a hard time finding them in the markets, but I won't be ordering from Amazon again.",positive
Working a desk job now and get the munchies from low energy sitting down too long. Can snack on these without feeling gross and bloated.,positive

"Perfect lo mein noodle and much healthier than a white flour version. Just make sure to rinse after cooking. If you don't they will be a gummy mess, don't ask me how I know.",positive
"I enjoy the smell of fresh coffee every time I open a bag of these pods. A great cup of coffee every time, and way less expensive than even the grocery store brands. Plus...no plastic in your landfill.",positive
"I highly recommend getting these chocolate sprinkles, it's excellent for eating with sliced bread, for baking, etc. Or just sprinkle when you are eating ice cream, pudding, milk shakes, etc. The taste is not so sweet and you can really taste the chocolate.",positive
I’ve noticed that I can’t taste any pumpkin flavor. I add pumpkin pie spice to my coffee. I’ve tested the coffee mate brand as well and it tastes normal for pumpkin pie flavor. Coffee mate cost more so in the end I buy this and add spice.,negative
I’m so glad I was able to get this though I waited until the last moment to order it. It was a beautiful piece of meat and the people I cooked it for LOVED it. 10/10 would order again.,positive

The Air Heads Xtremes bites taste nothing like the originally thin rope candy. It does not taste good. I was underwhelmed.,negative
Tastes like normal pancakes and is filling..plus with the regular flavor you can add things to change it up.,positive
It’s smells like pumpkin but just tastes sweet but doesn’t have the pumpkin flavorUpdate: They so graciously reached out and offered another flavor (vanilla).They sent it free of charge.I do like the vanilla much better and love the concern for customers.,positive
"It taste great and it is keto friendly!  I'm on keto and this is a good option to keep your immunity strong.  With my whole family getting sick, this saved me from getting sick along with them.  It works best in a blender bottle as it tends to clump of you just stir it.",positive
"These are mostly just plain vinegar. Not very balsamic, not very flavored, and very thin. Good balsamic is thick and rich. These seem like white vinegar with some dye and a hint of flavoring. Will not order again.",negative
"These things work perfect for me. I usually take them on my way to the gym and they keep me energized while there. I also use them as a pick-me-up for some late nights around town. My body is kind of sensitive to caffeine so I don't need much to get the effects. They should work for others too, just might have to have several mints.",positive
"This is my favorite Italian cookies, perfect for dipping in milk 🤎 I have ordered these cookies a few times, yesterday I received my order and one of the packages was not well sealed and had a big hole, the cookies were stale.

We haven't had an Advent calendar in years but decided to get one this year. We viewed a lot of them online & liked this one the best. It arrived in good condition & is really nice.

Taste greay,positive

"Tie Guan Yin Oolong Tea - Iron Goddess of Mercy: (Summit Tea Company)I must say that this Leaf Tea is the BEST I have tasted in the United States.

High Value considering the quality.Capt Rich",positive
"The pie crust was appropriately thick and easy to use, but those are the only good things I can say.  The most notable issue was the horrible taste.  It was bitter and lacked any flavor typical of a pie crust.  The cooked texture was dry and hard.  The edges, although only slightly brown, would crumble when cut.  Overall, this crust essentially ruined our two pies (one apple and the other mixed berry), despite the tasty homemade filling.  We’ll return to the more widely known brand the next time we don’t feel like making the crust from scratch.",negative
Couldn’t find in store. Good value. And product received within 2 days. :),positive
4 glass jars shipped in a bag with bubble wrap in 100* temps. Splurge for a box people. Two out of four came in with seal broken and had to be trashed. Otherwise best tasting chow chow ever made.,positive
Great clean taste.No need to add any sweetener.,positive
I found this tea to be too mild and tasteless. No matter how long it was brewed the taste was watery. I threw out the rest and will stick with Twinings.,negative
"We love the ease of making cold brewed tea; everything is made in one container. We just place the tea bag or bags in a glass or other container add some sweetener and water and put it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes or so, and we have the cold tea.",positive
"I would have liked more cereal in the box but I Ioved the flavors!The Cocoa is my fave because it's like dark chocolate which I love! You can put it in a bowl and snack on it dry, better than popcorn! I even mixed the cocoa and peanut butter flavor together and it was super good. The best thing is, it did not spike my blood sugar to a dangerous number! A tiny spike is normal when a Diabetic eats most anything, but no screamin' high jumps that are dangerous. I have found a really delish cereal that is just perfect for me! Oh, and I told my daughters who will be buying it for their families!",positive
I hate to give a bad review on a company who is willing to make healthy food since it's hard to find ready-made ANYTHING  that doesn't have a lot of added ingredients...But...I threw them away. They were so hard that I could not even chew them! Can't even imagine trying to roll them as a wrap!,negative
I found this to be very bland and a bit chalky.  I get that it's sugar free but it just isn't all that good especially for 50 calories.,negative

"Great flavor, looking for other foods to put it in and on. Very good!",positive
Not worth 26 dollars.  Kinda of sad I ordered it.,negative
"After try a TON of rubs, this is by far my favorite. One of my biggest complaints with rubs is that you can't really taste the flavor or that BBQ flavor that we all love. Not the case with this one. It has great flavor and works with just about any food you apply it to. Pork is favorite however with this brand. This is a solid A+ in my book.",positive
The smell is HORRIBLE!  Stunk up my entire porch.  These people had to know this was going to happen...nobody could be that stupid as to ship a glass jar wrapped in cellophane and shipped in a thin plastic bag!,negative
We were excited to try these on the recommendation of a friend. They taste pretty good. But... these are UNCLEAN- not Vegan!Monoglycerides used as emulsifier.  Very disappointed. It’s important to read all the ingredients!,negative

You can not eat part of a box. They are yummy!! Addictive!!! LOL.,positive
"I have been buying,and eating dried tart cherries for years. I just eat them, no cooking with them. These are probably the best.  Many of the other cherries are delicious, but I was intrigued by the sweetening with apple juice, rather than sugar.  There is a difference. They taste brighter, almost like a fresh cherry......tart but not so much to make you pucker up....and no really sweet sugar taste.",positive
This is great popcorn salt and very hard to find in my area.,positive

"I don't care what anyone says but you can most definitely taste the difference between this and sugar. This is vile. Sugar doesn't really have all that many calories per spoonful so I'll stick with that. Just like every other substitute I've tried, this will find it's way to the trash.",negative
havent been on in awhile.  no point anyways,negative
Perfect amount for 10-12 cup Bunn coffeemaker. I do not like the current Starbucks strong coffee binge so this works great for the restaurant strength coffee that I have been drinking for 50 years.,positive
"I love this tea, the first time I had it was at I-hop and knew I had to have it at home. I’m usually a Lipton tea drinker and love it but this tea is amazing. I don’t think it has as much caffeine as reg. Teas. Plus! It doesn’t stain my cup like Lipton does. I ordered my first time directly with the company then with amazon now again with the Company. I get the big round container and it has 60 tea bags in there and each are individual wrapped. I cannot see myself going back to Lipton tea.",positive
"Disappointed! , Picture says not from concentrate , I received concentrated pineapple juice . Because of poor packaging every can was dented on the top and sides .",negative
This is the best olive oil I have ever tasted.  Delicious and full of healthy antioxidants as it is unfiltered.,positive
Pieces of candy were missing and the package was open!,negative
"Like drinking silky smooth chocolate pudding. Use a spoon it's so good!  Be sure to watch the YouTube video for pointers on how to make drinking chocolate, it's very informative.",positive
The only knock on this is it's a little thin and the way the bottle is designed if you're not careful you're going to squirt it all over the place make a mess but the flavor is wonderful and if you need to watch your sugar this is the best thing you can have in place of the real maple syrup it tastes almost identical.,positive
"These little peeps were TINY! Barely an inch tall, they slid all over the pkg. Tasted just ok. Best go to Wal-Mart or local grocery. Poor value, high price.😒",negative
You get a lot of taffy in this bag,positive
"i was assured that i would receive the real sugar version pictured in the photo and not the new stevia version of sierra mist, but all case were the new horrible version.",negative
"I tried twice to use this yogurt culture.  The first time my thermometer wasn't working right, so I had to guess on the temperature.  I figured it was my fault that one didn't set up.  It was totally liquid, and tasted a bit like buttermilk.  The second time I tried it, I had a working thermometer, and the temperature was exactly right according to the directions.  I used the method where you put it in a tight-fitting bowl inside a cooler, covered with a towel.  When I took it out after 8 hours, it still felt warm, but was totally liquid.  Maybe I got a bad batch.",negative
"These have a good taste, but mine were so stiff when I wrapped them it just fell apart.",negative
What can I say.. good value.,positive
"There are far more cinnamon sticks in this packet than i had expected.  Great deal, hopefully i can use all of them before they loose their scent.",positive
"It's cookies, how can you go wrong?",positive
"There was one coffee drinker in our household out of five people until now, that is until Death Wish Coffee....  I was never into coffee until I tried Death Wish.  It makes drinking coffee an amazingly fun experience.  You had me at organic, but the caffeine content is the icing on the cake or the froth on your cappuccino!  I never understood these coffee drinkers who drink their disgusting Folgers or something similar in the morning.  It never seemed to do them any good, they all still looked like zombies going about their days.  That crappy coffee and other like it are full of poisons, nasty.  Death Wish coffee is the complete opposite and is absolutely amazing and organic.  The flavor, the aroma, the freshness, the caffeine content, the smoothness, and being organic all make drinking this coffee a truly fun-filled experience.  I am happy to report all five members of this household are all now hooked on Death Wish coffee.  It is absolutely superior to all other coffees!  We drink it at all times of the day and night.  It makes you feel alert and focused without feeling jittery or nauseous which is amazing since I was always sensitive to caffeine which is why I never really drank coffee.  The roasting process makes this coffee absolutely wonderful.  All five of us here ages 19 to 54 in this household give Death Wish coffee nothing but praise and tell everyone about it.  It is a must try.  Once you try it, I guarantee you too will be hooked.  Get a 5-pound bag of this delicious coffee on subscribe and save so you never run out.  This coffee also makes a great gift for all occasions.  This coffee is definitely a conversation starter.  So go ahead and order now and enjoy your Death Wish coffee!",positive
I opened one can and it was nasty.  I don't have the courage to open another can. I will be pouring this stuff down the drain.,negative
Wow everything i’ve ordered from Amazon i have been very pleased with and most important how quick i get my orders,positive
They had a very artificial flavor!,negative
You can never go wrong with chocolate cupcakes!!,positive
Just like I remember. This is the best spice on earth! Only thing is I wish it was organic. The way they pair the herds and spices.,positive
"I love this medium roast coffee, i love the flavor",positive
Going,positive
Never tried this stuff before but it's just not for me. Has a really different taste than I was expecting. Packing is cool?,negative
"I enjoy the unsalted pistachios even more than the salted ones.  Unsalted, they have their own unique flavor.",positive
"This is my favorite flavored coffee, Just can't get enough of it. I enjoy it at work and often share it with my adult daughter.",positive
Great for mixing into Greek yogurt to stay full for longer!,positive
this should state that its TAHINI PASTE.  This is my second jar and there's no liquid at all.  I re-purchased it thinking that the first jar may have been old and dried out (even though the expiration date was well into the future).  Very difficult to work with.,negative
"I like dark roast coffees in general, and the Italian roast is a good strong roast without being bitter.",positive
"I absolutely love these thin stackers. They are light,  tasty, and they go well with sweet and salty foods.My stomach tolerates them well.The price is also competitive.",positive
What happened to nutritional content??  It used to be 100% but now it is only 20 or 25% ??  When and why did this change?  I have eaten it for 25 or more years.  Thank you,negative
I jean I love them nothing else to say.,positive
My favorite waffle mix! We have a double sided waffle maker and always have this on hand.The best part is that you just add water which makes it easy to travel with!,positive
terrible flat taste --- i paid a lot because it said premium --  they are the worst ever,negative
Would buy again. Very good quality.,positive
We throughly enjoy the K-cups -- best dark roast coffee we have had.,positive
"We like that it is a small bottle that doesn’t need to take up space in the fridge, yet it makes great tasting coffee that is just like the iced coffee we get pre-made from the refrigerated section of the store!",positive
"Buyer beware! I have ordered these several times in the past and have also purchased at a members only big box store. This last bag from this seller was absolutely disgusting, it had a weird chemical taste and they also smelled past their prime. I would urge you to purchase from an actual store. I won’t be taking any chances and purchasing from here again, honestly so gross!!!",negative
Cheap and easy,positive
Very delicious and flaky biscotti.,positive
Way over priced 😡,negative
I hate the taste of honey usually but this honey isn’t bad at all. It’s so good!!! I just bought another large bottle since it’s the only one I can tolerate. Will stick with this brand as long as they continue ti make it!,positive
So far we like the product but someone doesn't know how to pack it very well no bubble wrap at all.,negative
"Really nice truffle oil! Nice fragrance and taste, I loved cooking with this product. I was so sad when we used it all and definitely foresee myself buying more in the future.",positive
"The chia seeds were fresh and well-packaged, and the price was great.  The vendor also enclosed some samples of the other products they carry.  The seeds can be sprinkled on or added to so many foods, since they are about the size of sugar grains, and have a mild flavor. This vendor will be my go-to chia source from now on!",positive
"I did not care for the flavor and the cut is funky. I purchased by mistake, usually get Wright thick bacon.",negative
The only thing I liked was the barrels my son now uses to play with his zombies flavor was ok I have had way worse but these are barely sour I was so disappointed I won't purchase again,negative
This product has met my expectations and above,positive
Flowers were beautiful. Arrived Thursday needed for Flea Market Saturday and Sunday. Flowers were still looking good the next Tuesday even after being outside Sat and Sun. Would definitely buy again,positive
Snacks for all.,positive
Package came opened with the chocolate bars fallen out not really an issue. But they are NOT FULL SIZED BARS!!!! I got the 179 gram pack when I paid for the 212 gram pack. Rip-off/scam.,negative
"I’m addicted to this product.  I was getting it from Ralphs supermarket, but they ran out and I wasn’t sure when it would be back in.It takes very little time to put these in a LIGHTLY oiled non stick sauté pan, and fry.  I’ve wrapped up chickens, egg salad, and just a bit of shredded cheese at times for a quick snack.  They taste great and are flaky when cooked right.  They will puff a bit as they start to be cooked through.I’m sure there are many more ways to use these Paratha pancakes, but I’m not even halfway through it’s uses.They arrive frozen so make sure someone is home to accept them, because if they get defrosted it will be hard to manipulate them into a pan.",positive
"I enjoy a cup of hot tea at bedtime. This one is a very cozy, Christmasy tea!",positive
"This is some funny rice,It doesnt cook well at all.",negative
I enjoy the taste and the texture Is Not Unusual,positive
These are delicious! Wish they weren’t so expensive,positive
"Interesting flavor (tried all 3 of them). Had fun experimenting with it, including in cocktails as a ""bitters."" Makes a great ponzu sauce (better than commercial). I will definitely use this again.",positive
Very few broken pieces. Perfect amt of salt for me. Most are way too salty,positive
Love shells and cheese and this is the brand I always buy.,positive
I love these things! I order them to take with me to the field (Army) or when I'm done with a workout. Sometimes I eat like a bird and don't get enough protein so these really help. super easy for on the go. I find myself just grabbing one and heading out the door if I'm running late (often) or if I am hungry at night it's a healthier option! freaking awesome.,positive
Definitely will buy again!!!!,positive
We live this coffee full flavor but not bittet,positive
Delicioous!,positive
Note to self - don't order chocolate from overseas.  when it gets here it's a melted clump. :)  my bad.,positive

I LOVE this spaghetti and meatballs it’s super delicious and flavorful seasoned just right and if I could eat it everyday I would lol,positive
THS DOES NOT TASTE THE SAME AS IT USED TO. Seems like its bitter and has no hazelnut flavor. I wonder if its being repackaged?,negative
I make this with really cold soft tofu and a pinch of baking soda or creme of tartar in a blender for extra fluff. Very filling and satisfying.,positive
"This is the first time I've been able to find a multi pack of dried mangos. They are a great, healthy snack & now I can throw a pack in my bag to eat at work when I need something sweet that won't make me crash later.",positive
Delicious flavor with soft chewy centers; very fresh and delivery was quick.,positive
Was buying bottles Gatorade to work now I make putchers and fill hydroflask. Good deal.,positive
I like dandelion root tea. It usually looks dark almost like coffee and has a distinct taste. I have no idea what I am drinking with this product and if it has even a percentile fraction of dandelion root.,negative
This one is my favorite flavor and never lets me down.  Very refreshing with ice.,positive
The product arrived well Worth the price I'll order another one to finish 😊😊The product arrived exactly as described !!!,positive
"I love to use sliced almonds in everything from salads, to vegetable side dishes, to smoothies, soups, and, of course, baked goods. This zip-top package from Fisher keeps them sweet and crunchy. (Though I admit, I pour my nuts into screw-top canisters once they're opened.) The package can either stand up or be stored flat in your cupboard or on your counter. These are fresh, quality nuts sliced thin so they are easy to chew (my husband and I both have to watch out for hard nuts with our aging teeth). Amazon delivers them fast, in perfect shape. Great pantry item.",positive
Absolutely horrendous taste!,negative
My favorite hot cereal. I add dried fruit and nuts for a healthy breakfast.,positive
This is a favorite of mine. Give it a try Im sure you will like it too.,positive
"I usually purchase the refill bag, since it has been the only thing available when I was purchasing. I was happy to get a smaller tin that I can keep near my Keurig to save space. It is a nice little container.The tea itself is delicious. It has a nice, savory taste of seaweed and the sea and the bite of ume plum. It is probably an acquired taste, but if you have the taste is a wonderful drink. I will add that I usually add more of the mix than the instructions say, but I like a stronger taste.If you like Japanese food and drinks, then definitely give this a try.",positive
"I’m so disappointed! My tin of cookies arrived without the product description of a protective insert. I absolutely love these cookies & will eat these: crumbs & all. But I say $18 is awfully expensive for a tin of crumbs!! What if I’d been wanting to give them as a gift? That would be embarrassing. I’ve emailed the company, and if I get good customer service, I’ll edit my review.",negative
These beans smell and taste amazing. I'm using these in a Manuel Drip process. They brew the best coffee I've had in a long time. I will definitely purchase these again.,positive
We use this for all recipes diabetic!,positive
I sent these “care packages” to my grandkids.  They loved receiving them!,positive

Awesome absolutely loved them and came on time in a resealable bag,positive
"The label  says MARS but the candy inside is Milky Way! And a poor imitation of that ! Someone should check and see what really happened to the original MARS bars, cause these ain't it!!",negative
The flavor is tangy sweet like I remember years ago. They are chewier than those with sulfur dioxide and darker in color. They make a great healthy snack. Soak them for recipes that need soft fruit.,positive
"I absolutely love this product. This coffee taste excellent, and it is an excellent value for your money. Would recommend to anyone",positive
"Wow, I was introduced to Mauby Fizz several months ago. A friend of mine had some and I was competely blown away. I've since ordered some for myself twice and will continue to do so.It's hard to describe the flavor to anyone who has not drank digestifs. If you've had Chinotto, Mauby Fizz is a less bitter a slightly more sweet entry that I could possibly categorize it into. Even if you aren't into bitter drinks, you might like this.I'm in heaven with this drink and wish I could order in a higher volume at a little bit of a discount. But that's the reality of imports. It really is worth trying this out at least once. Hey, you're only getting 3 bottles so if you hate it, you only have two to give away!Do it!",positive
Almost forgot about Mother’s Day so I bought this last minute. I know I’m terrible but still mom loves it so it’s a win!,positive
Best mustard I’ve ever had!!!!!!,positive
"Please Altoids, don't discontinue the ginger flavor.  I have about three attacks of vertigo a year and using the ginger mints cuts the time to recover in half.  I had to look long and hard for my last box.  I am delighted that Amazon has them.  P.S.  I also pop them before any boat ride as they hold off seasickness.",positive
This is rice is between Brown rice & white rice. The rice has more flavor and the texture is great.  It’s worth the price for this brand of Rice.,positive
"Let me begin by saying that I purchased this for my mother in May 2018. The photo attached is roughly a year later. It was thriving from the moment it arrived—except for a few of the bottom leaves had some discoloration due to shipping (as these are live plants). I know a great deal about plants, but my mother doesn’t know much lol! This has been the absolute best. It now touches her ceiling and it is easily valued at $200+. The care has been minimal, and there are a great deal of resources online for what they need. This purchase in 2018 has exceeded our expectations in every way, and we look forward to buying from this company again!!",positive
"Delicious and really hits the spot! LOVE the natural ingredients, and that you don't have to sacrifice flavor buying a boxed meal",positive
i hate coffee but this product has brought me into the world of chemical dependancy.  how can I say thank you enough!!,positive
Love the smell and the taste,positive
"instead of the 12 ounces of ground coffee, I received 12 single serving K-cups.  Not the same product, not the same price.  How do I return these?",negative
"I just don't get these reviews! I can't help thinking they are written by the sort of L.O.G fan who would worship anything they ever do without questioning whether it is actually any good.I'm a massive fan of the programme but thought this film was a pointless project. I could forgive the ridiculous plot if I had come out of the cinema having laughed more than twice. At one point, I thought it might just me before I realised hardly any laughs were minting from the rest of audience.I wasn't expecting much of a plot (very few TV comedies stand up to being stretched over 90 minutes) but thought the odd bit of classic L.O.G dialogue or visual joke (like at the start of each programme) would carry a film. After 5 minutes of the 17th Century plot, I was begging for it to end (little did I know it would carry on for the rest of the film). It just wasn't funny.I was just massively disappointed and can't see history being too kind to it, even if a few die-hard fans write enthusiastic reviews.",negative
Nasty I wouldn't buy again threw all away after I piece,negative
Great and arrived before said time,positive
I like the convenience of the packets to be able to carry.  Also good when you don’t have lemon juice or fresh lemons at home,positive
"Súper recomiendo este producto es súper delicioso , lo ocupo para mi café tiene un sabor increíble cremoso ligero me encanta y también para mascarillas con miel , yogurt y me deja el rostro muy fresco e hidratado lo volveré a comprar .",positive
"What's in this...OMG...it's not what everyone thinks it is.  So DISGUSTING, I'd rather just pull a lump of grass with dirt and bugs in it to eat than put this MYSTERY GARBAGE in my body.  Actually, you will ALL be better off eating Grass with Dirt and bugs mixed in.",negative
"Perhaps a specialty item to some, these were a staple in my wife's house when she grew up.  Quality, freshness and flavor matched not only her expectations but her memories...a great find and far superior to any other available off the shelf.  Seems pricey but the jar is huge and keeps in the fridge just fine.",positive
"For our first attempt at making Paella, with our Spanish exchange student, I knew I needed to get authentic ingredients.  Well, we didn't get the correct chorizo, but we got the right rice! It turned out great, in fact it may just turn into our new go-to recipe when we don't know what to make for dinner.  Everyone loved it! It comes in a fabric linen bag. Came quickly, as expected, which was great...when we decided to make it, we wanted to make it now!",positive
"Love this product, not found locally so bought on line.",positive
"I love Sweets Taffy.  I've tried Taffy Towne and Taffy Shop too. To me, these other brands offered Taffy with an oily taste and much less flavor.  Amazon refunded my money.Taffy by Sweets is perfect!  No oily taste and the flavors are outstanding!I love the cinnamon too but, because of the dental work I had done in various places, the red coloring temporarily stains those particular areas.  Most people shouldn't have a problem though.If you're on the fence about ordering, I'd suggest you give it a try! I my opinion, you won't regret it  :)",positive
These taste great and are easy to travel with!,positive
My favorite flavor to date,positive
"Excellent waffle mix.  Waffles turned out great, and the family loves them!",positive
Excellent to add to cinnamon toast and cereal like Cheerios!,positive
"i bought these alongside the regular jimmy dean egg bacon cheese biscuits and honestly the egg bacon cheese biscuit was pretty f'n grosss. then i had one of these this morning and my god the quality is like 10x as good. It's literally the same as if you made it fresh from home. these sandwiches are so good i'm about to buy a few more boxes because i swear i could eat a whole box of 12 in one sitting lol they're THAT GOOD! not greasy, fresh taste, english muffin isnt soggy or flavorless. perfect lil breakfast sandwich that doesn't add inches to your wasteline. definitely a must have in your freezer makes breakfast a breeze",positive
I did not open the sealed package as it’s obviously full of broken breadsticks. I would like a refunds!!,negative

This is my daughter’s fav!  And she is a Jalepeno Chip Afficianado.,positive
If you are looking for zero calorie sweetener for baking this is the best I've come across. What's great about this brand it donesnt have a bunch of junk in it like dextrose or artificial sweeteners that are very harmful to your health. As advertised this is just stevia. Some other stevia brands have sugar alcohols in it like erythitol and not everyone can tolerate it cause it can cause digestive pain. I personally can not use erythitol because it gives me digestive pain. This bottle maybe be small but a little goes a long way. When I bake I used half the amount the sugar called for in the recipe(sometimes less) and then I substitute the rest with this till I get the desired sweetness I want. I usually use a tablespoon for a whole recipe. If you are diabetic/low carb keto or just looking to loose weight or avoid sugar all together this works just as well using this as the only sweetener. I personally just like using coconut sugar with this because coconut sugar has a unique taste. All in all I would highly recommend this product. It's really a staple in my kitchen.,positive
"The local grocery chain where I used to get this closed, so I was pleased to find I could get it on Amazon and in a handy 12lb bag! Since I walk to the grocery store six months out of the year, I love not having to buy a new, smaller, 2lb bag every few weeks. I've been hooked on their rice for a long time because it's higher fiber than other brown rice (3 grams instead of the usual 2 or less), which is important to me for health reasons. To top it all off, there is their commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. I also enjoy the quality of their product. Other brown rices I've used tend to have a husk or two in every serving, but husks have been extremely rare in Lundberg rice. I'm alright with paying more for organic and the social and environmental pluses that come with it, but if the added expense bothers you, go for Lundberg's regular brown rice. I've gotten it from time to time when the organic was out of stock at my grocery store (before I learned I could get it here), and it's good stuff, too!",positive
"This is a fantastic trail mix, it tastes awesome. I bought the bag for a 5 day backpacking trip and regretted it every step. It tastes fantastic but is SO heavy!",positive
The product is fine; but the handling gets one star.  A can was missing from the package.  The outer box and packing material were undamaged; so it appears it left Amazon that way.  Sometimes brick and mortar are still best.,negative
"I’d say this is one of my favorite hot sauce brands, this is the first time I’ve had ‘Tears of the Sun’, it has a great flavor with a medium heat level.",positive

Great product for pies!,positive
It is hard to find iodized large crystal salt for a table grinder. This Antica Salina (old salt?) brand is much less expensive than the Seasonello brand.,positive
"Smooth, spicy tea. Could be spicier. The aroma is amazing. Should definitely give this a try if you love Chai tea. So simple and easy to make.",positive
"Very pleased with this product.  The consistency is not as thick as some honeys, but it's dark and sweet and  complex tasting.  A spoonful is good mixed in a glass of water first thing in the morning.  Quick and trouble-free shipping.",positive
"Blech, uber stale and metallic tasting. Must be an old batch. I have better luck buying this brand in the store, but even so I've switched to a local store brand of beans that are much, much fresher.",negative
Stale rice..... again !!,negative
As shown. Very cute,positive
Came Smashed,negative
Great packaging fresh and tasty!,positive
Great for cocktails! Excellent flavor. Much cheaper than Luxardo!,positive
The pods are too large for the Keurig which makes it difficult for enough water to steep through to get a full cup of coffee.,negative
"We use it to make scrambled tofu, mac and ""cheese"", and anything else that needs a cheesy or eggy flavor.The price is pretty good on Amazon. In the grocery store, a 5 oz container cost $6.",positive
They always come very fresh and are completely better than the grocery store ones,positive
Delicious and makes me feel full without the added carbs and calories,positive
We all LOVE the cream soda and ginger root beer. Orange and grape are also good. Cola is a solid RC-cola like soda.,positive

This is the best verde hot sauce out there. It's tiny and full of flavor and just right for whatever you put it on not too hot not too cool but just right. Try his other sauces to because they're all excellent,positive
This chicken seasoning base comes in handy when I don't have time to make homemade chicken stock.  I especially like that it's low sodium.  This is my second order of vogue cuisine chicken base.

This was so cute at our wedding. It was exactly what I wanted.,positive
Grows and grows like a champ and does the job like it should.,positive
"Disappointed to find that a good number of the rainbows were flaked off when they arrived. Not only did they not look new, I was worried about the paint flaking into the cupcakes. I didn't use them for our birthday cupcakes. Would not recommend. These could have been so cute if the quality was better!",negative
"This item received does NOT look like the picture. If you think that this is similar to Italian porscuitto ham, it is not.I have bought once Virginia country ham that was very similar to what I had as a kid in Eastern Europe,this is not it.Way to salty and the picture is totally different than pale raw looking salty peace of pork",negative

Used before is acceptable sweetner,positive
This was an amazing find . A very healthy snack . The bags are small so I got 7 packets . I will buy again soon,positive
The product came and was sticky and many of the packs were broken.  Horrible.  How can you eat something sent in such a condition?,negative

"This product has been used for generations in making Polish cookies and pastries.None of the stores within driving range (we live in Lexington, Ky) carry SOLO Purne Plum product. Most carry a few of the others, like Apricot, which we also use.",positive
I love this brand of almonds. They are a bit pricey but it's ok. I'm overseas and it's not available here so I have to deal with it. It's always fresh and sealed. I would repurchase,positive
"After seeing such great reviews this was disappointing. Is this the communist idea what cappuccino taste like? Proportions of sugar, milkpowder and instant coffee are just off(they also have a bunch of other additives for fillers) . I was expecting wawa quality cappucino (it's automated/instant, so was hoping it could be duplicated at home), but one can only dream. This brand is a little creamer in coffee with some sugar. I can even forego the foam effect (they did too). But for crying out loud, the flavor should be at least close to a cappucino...and it's not.",negative
Thank you for providing good quality fructose. My husband is a Type 1 diabetic and this is the only sweetner I can bake with that doesn't taste funny and will not raise his blood sugar.,positive
"Not a fan!  My son has to eat dairy free now, and we are searching for a dairy free cheese.  This is the second one we have tried, and it just isn't good.  It does not melt and honestly has a horrible taste.  The texture is even worse.  It sticks to the roof of your mouth like peanut butter.It's disappointing cause he loves pizza but now can't eat it unless the cheese is dairy free.  Hoping we find a good one soon.",negative
I can’t get these in my local grocery store. They are great in cinnamon scones or muffins.,positive

This is real 100% Japanese Green tea.I like this tea and recommended to everybodyIt is the best quality tea.,positive
Disappointed to receive product dated for 8/19/19 on 10/20/19. Sellers can do better than this and should provide customers with the highest quality by ensuring stock is current. The product is self is ok. But I expect to receive coffee that at least has not exceeded the best by date.,negative

Perfect. Flavor is amazing and the container is nice too. It is loose leaf so make sure you order some tea bags (I have besego tea filter bags and they work perfectly with this),positive
I love the taste of this soup. It is high in protein.,positive
My doctor recommended a high polyphenol olive oil and this one fits the bill. Single source straight from the farm. Excellent!,positive
One of the best peanut butter I've ever tasted!,positive
This is as close to the real thing as you can come with low carbs.,positive
"I'm a fish lover, and am very picky to the choices I'm making with eating seafood. This trout snack surprised me for its delicious and flavorful taste. I like that is is sustainable fishing from USA and that I 'm helping support Made of America product. I like a lot the convenience of the packaging, I took some with me on a hike, my 7 years old and I devoured it. I highly recommend getting this seafood snack.",positive
It was a great surprise to be able to purchase Arm & Hammer Pure Baking Soda in such a large bag and a case of two.  The size and price was the best I've ever found.  This is the second time I've ordered it and I will order it again.,positive
Scared to try,negative
Not worth the hassle of returning but they are barely edible as all the bread portion has crumbled away from the date filling.,negative

My favorite one-bottle season for all meats.,positive
This is best and most flavorful of all the kuerig decafs.,positive
I am totally amazed at this product my only complaint is that it doesn't make very much at all it doesn't even fill the bag half full,positive
Kids at the birthday party loved getting special rock candy sticks.,positive
"Our son gave us the first bag of Lakanto Monkfruit sweetner. We were hooked. My daughter mixes it with cinnamon for her applesauce. I use it in anything that calls for sugar. No aftertaste, dissolves quickly.",positive
I bought this for second time and it is so delicious as the taste at home. Thank you for providing this item here,positive
Great coffee. Strong but smooth.,positive
"This was not a variety pack. I received 24 k-cups, as specified, but I only received one each of chocolate covered almond, coconut bunny, and Maple French toast. The other 21 k-cups were Belgian chocolate truffle, snickerdoodle, and butterscotch. Very disappointed, and upset.",negative

"These will go perfect on my daughters cake. A little larger than what I expected, which is fine!",positive

This is one of our favorite almond flours. It is one of the most fine.,positive

So very satisfying with minimum guilt!  Love the taste,positive
Very pleased! Fresh and taste Great! Will purchase again!,positive
"I'd found smaller packages of these candies at a chain-store at Christmas time. This past Christmas, I couldn't find it anywhere. Right before Christmas, I ordered the mixed from another vendor selling the brand I always found in stores. Sorely disappointed because it contained very little of these candies(and the $ was twice as much!) I found these and was thrilled! First off, they were/are fresh. They taste exactly like what I remembered as a kid and what I'd found in the mixed packages. The price is comparable. I paid $8 for two much smaller packages at the ""discount"" store and a bit more for the same size packages through Amazon. So, the price per weight seems very fair.",positive
Quick to prepare and tasty on your mashed potatoes!,positive
"Wow! I mean what a tea box. I am so just moved by the little leaflet they have included with the teas and to see a picture of our Bulgarian gypsies in the rose field ❤ picking the petals of our rose infused land and for this company to create such beautiful branding and experience to its customers around the world! Thank you, i absolutely appreciate the thoughtful packaging,  the sustainability and just the care from field to table.I tried their night time blend and was absolutely hooked so i saw this box and decided to try the other blends. I have no doubt it will be a great sipping experience:). Thank you Pukka! (By the way i also call my dog that lol so... that's something isn't it)",positive
"My children couldn’t believe all the Jolly Rancher flavors they had back when we were kids.  Now they believe me!  The Mango is a new flavor, I think.  The lime tastes like a fresh key-lime.  There are old favorites, like grape, watermelon, and cherry, and peach. It’s great that the candies last for a long time.  True that you have to brush your teeth really well afterwards, but it’s worth it!",positive
Just love these and they are so hard to find in stores.,positive
"One 20 oz cup lasts per tank of gas, no bathroom breaks on 300 mi. trips. No acid aftertaste. flavorful great ""coffee"" taste. Always has thet first cup of the day fresh taste.Have purchased 5 bags over time.",positive
"One of them broke in half during shipment. Poor little guy! 🧸😭 The item is ""non-returnable"" so there's nothing I can do about this. Can't use it like this either, as more tiny pieces will inevitably break off into the sugar... Pretty disappointing!",negative
"I like this more than soy sauce, and I'm Chinese. It tastes great with my high protein tofu. Plus, it's got 3 grams of protein per tablespoon.",positive
Order missing the roasted garlic packages,negative
I like other brands much better.  This is WAY over seasoned.  Yuck.  I'm trying to give it away since I had to order six boxes.,negative
I love this product so much! It actually came faster than I thought it would and the bottle looks much bigger in person than it does in the photos. I think it's also delicious on anything. I drizzled some on mozzarella at a recent party and got so many compliments on it. I will definitely continue to buy it!,positive
Good flavor and scent. Nothing like a mug of green tea and a good book.  And it's decaffeinated.  YAY.  Take time to enjoy the scent and taste. Relaxation here I come. Thank you Lipton. Thank you AMAZON.,positive
"The pic shows the old dinner and package.  The old one had carrots, zucchini @nd a few green beans.  Light but tasty sauce.  What you get will contain edamame.  Kinda important for people to know since many are allergic to soy.",negative
3 of the packs were open inside the box so they were not safe to eat and has to be thrown out.,negative
"Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have! I know he is not like SUPER-known, but she is really a great actress! Stingers makes me want to be a cop! I LOVE IT!P.S: Do you know if you can buy the episodes?",positive
Love this light refreshing tea!,positive
Not flavorful enough.  Made Protein shake.,negative
These taste like nothing but mint horrible,negative
"My family and I really enjoyed the change in dining. The process was very simple, the aroma in the house while cooking was amazing. The spices, sauces and chopsticks all included. We added shrimp and just loved it. I like how you can customize it for each individual as my kids don’t care for spicy, but my wife and I do. Will be getting more very soon.",positive
I fell in love with this Tea while visiting Ireland. It is not the usual one that is consumed over there barry's or lyons. Strong dark yet not bitter perfect for my mornings. Arrives fast in perfect condition. It used to be in my local supermarket but no longer so I order from Amazon,positive
"Out of all their different kinds of cookies, this is the one that rocks.You would never know this was gluten free.",positive

Very tasty friendly’s rich flavored coffee,positive
"The best on the market ! Worth the price.Very easy to prepare.Hodson Mill makes honest,full bodied( yes,I say it about the flour too,not just wine),deliciously tasting pancake mix.If you love the taste of buckwheat,it is there,but rather a hint,a tease,a nice reminder of the wholesomeness of the  food you are eating.We make pancakes  from this mix a couple time a week.It "" sticks to your ribs"".We add chopped ham  sometimes ,but mostly we eat it plain with sour cream ( in Russian style) or with a bit of honey.This is my ode to this wondeful product.",positive
"Straight out of the package, I originally thought they were hard candies. They are tough and very chewy. I prefer soft candies. Flavori is delicious though. This might be a personal preference thing.",negative
"Finally, a bar I can actually eat that isn't too sweet. But there's plenty of flavor and definitely leaves you feeling full. Delicious and I will be ordering more of!",positive
"Their flavors are all delicious, but these two are my favorites.  It doesn't taste ""sugar free"", so my kids and grandkids eat it on their waffles, pancakes, ice cream, etc., too!  Great job, Choc Zero! ❤️",positive
"I can eat a whole can of these at a time.  Simply delicious and like no other, thus why I pay so much to have them shipped to me via Amazon!",positive
"Good bargain. Fresh, great flavor. Can't boil shrimp for cocktail without Old Bay.",positive
Really like this coffee.  And the price.  No complaints.,positive
Bought this having read all the reviews. It cannot compare with the powdered form. I had to use 5x the supposed amount to sweeten my tea. When I want sweet.....since I STARVE to stay slim.....I want sweet. It's my only treat.Fortunately my powder arrived 4 days later.,negative
buy peeled garlic,negative
I love this syrup it tastes great.,positive
Yuk. These pop nicely...into very large pretty puffs but they are tasteless & have a mushy mouthfeel. I usually like trader joe products but this one is terribly disappointing.,negative
"Tomorrow afternoon (well, later today actually) is a shoot with Seattle Sinner Newspaper and Femme Fatale Seattle photographers",neutral
"These are an awesome alternative to sour candy. They satisfy my craving without feeling too unhealthy. If you can find them at your local grocery store, they are usually cheaper than the listing here of $10 for 6 boxes.",positive
Fruit fresh - great for adding to candy recipes as a sour flavor enhancer and preservative.,positive
Not good at all. Flavor and even the looks of it were not appealing.,negative
"Nothing but A SEA OF SALT!!! No Flavor what so Ever just SALT mix with Color. Had to Improvise with those Spices you see 🙈. Make sure you have on hand a container large enough for 1/2 so you can start your process of creating flavors with lots of Sugar, Garlic, Onion Powder, White Pepper,and Paprika and anything else with no SALT.Don't throw Away! Make it your own way.You can see how much I end up with when finished.FULL TO THE RIM",negative
I am very disappointed to say all three flavors are absolutely disgusting. Sadly not able to be returned. Please don’t waste your money like I did..,negative

Yummy yummy is a million words in one,positive
"I've been a vegetarian for over 30 years now but still remember beef jerky!  This is the closest thing I've found to real beef jerky.  The consistency is good and the flavor is strong enough but not overpowering. I ate the bag the first day I got it! I will definitely be getting this again.  Of course, like all jerky it seems, you'd love to get just a little more in the pack for your money, but again I loved it so much that I'll be back.",positive
I bought this flour because Ken Forkish recommended it in his pizza book. I had previously bought Caputo semolina flour to add to my regular all purpose flour when making pizza. That flour is a great addition to all purpose if you want to branch out a bit on your pizza crust making before committing to the pizza flour.But this flour is much better than all purpose. It is very fine and holds a lot of moisture so you can get a crispy crust but you have to watch the timing carefully to make sure it is fully cooked. Also if you use Forkish’s method of stretching the dough the Caputo flour really shows its stuff. You can get an amazing thin crust with no holes. Or if you do get a hole this flour seals back up really well.And finally I think it is a great deal for the price.,positive
"Outstanding Christmas aromas and flavors, smooth.  You can smell the aromas from a cup of this tea from a noticeable difference, and it will fill a room with those aromas.",positive
"Amazed at the quality. I've bought in local stores over the last year, NOW I know the are selling old product / poor product. This order is Fresh,Dates are moist/ sticky sweet. Don't need soaking. Great product.",positive
Product is fresh.  Great flavor.  Label may be a little loose.  Not a big deal.,positive
"This is, by far, my favorite dip.  It is creamy, full of flavor, with a slight spicy tang finish.  It is great with pita bread, crackers, veggies, or just an alternative to mayo for a sandwich!  My sister can't get it where she lives so she stocks up whenever she visits!",positive
Just what I needed to feed the small animals on my property,positive
I read about sprouted nuts so I took a chance and ordered them. I will never eat a unsprouted nut again. The crunch and flavor are amazing! I highly recommend these nuts.,positive
Hurray! Pasta for the rest of us that doesn't cook up all weird or taste odd.,positive
[[VIDEOID:54446c398c23f5227280c300817b7769]] The package now is called Original Pancake Bites not Dutch Pancake bites. The bites no longer have the wonderful flavor as we were getting from the product produced in Belgium.  Very disappointing!,negative
I bought this specifically because the online product stated  and pictured the label “NO MSG”But the product sent lists MSG as the second main ingredient right after salt,negative
"Not all cream cheeses are equal, and Philadelphia Cream Cheese is one of our favorites. It's perfect in Quesadillas, on Sourdough Toast, and in Turkey Enchiladas.While this particular cream cheese is gone (because cream cheese doesn't last long in our home), the plastic container makes it easy to keep it fresh and use it during cooking, since you would just scoop out the necessary amount.. unlike the little bricks wrapped in foil, which seem like they may be better suited for baking. Additionally, purchasing 16oz was about a dollar more than purchasing an 8oz brick, so it was an easy decision.",positive
"I got these for quick meal sides and it's been awhile since I've made them.  The flavor wasn't great, maybe the powdered broccoli flavor. If you add chicken or something I hope it tastes better",negative
"These have a great cheesy flavor and really are very crisp. It’s a nice serving size, at 100 calories!",positive
The best of the rods. Some boxes could be fresher,positive
Ordered this for a gift. Came completely damaged. Tried to straighten it our best I could. Pictures are after trying to do that. Why send something so easily damaged with no protection around it? What a waste of money and time.,negative
As advertixed,positive
"These arrived and despite an expiration date well in the future, they tasted like cardboard - almost no flavor and incredibly dry.  I have enjoyed Rip Van waffles before, but this was disgusting.  I couldn't even get down the first bite, it was almost like cocoa powder flavored dust.  I have no idea why these are so bad.  Be aware.",negative
Terrible!!!! The smell.  Omg.,negative
Tastes great!  Easy to use. Packs in a small space.,positive
"The taste isn't great, but I've tried straight Amazing Greens and that stuff is vile. This berry flavor make it tolerable, as long as I have my morning coffee standing by to wash it down! I mix it with ground flaxseed and chia seed to get my omegas first thing in the morning. Definitely a part of my routine I feel benefits my health.",positive
Super cute novelty,positive
"A wonderful salt, fine enough to cook with and you only need to add a small amount. Adds great flavor.",positive
i use in my cold brew maker in the fridge. it holds a week worth. kitchen aid.,positive
These gummy worms lived up to the reviews I had read about how good their flavor was. I couldn't stop eating them! Definitely better than the standard longer gummy worms (don't know the brand name). This bag was enough to go around at a 60 person baby shower. I put them in small tin buckets on each table.,positive
Great coffee very reasonable price quick delivery hard to find in grocery stores for one cup coffee makers that use this type of coffee pads,positive
I liked the coffee flavor so much I used it to make Irish coffee for an evening with friends using the recipe from the Buena Vista in SF.,positive
I recently have discovered that I am gluten intolerant so wheat flour noodles/ramen is off my menu.  I really loved the packaged noodles and finding this sauce was like a blessing xD it's not as spicy as the package and a little more sweet but it's still awesome; and since it is a sauce i've been adding it to other food too so that's a bonus!,positive
Product arrived damaged. It had exploded all over the inside of the Amazon prime box. It had also ruined all other items included in the box. Went to get the item replaced on my Amazon account and was told it is ineligible for replacement. What a joke!,negative
I love dark roast coffee and this is 1 of my favorites.,positive
"It's what I'm accustomed to drinking, only less expensive.  I would recommend it to anyone who is enamoured of the French Roast.  I spent a lot of time in France teaching computer applications and came to prefer their coffee.  This comes closest.",positive
"It's just ok, nothing fantastic. I didn't expect it to be chunky, i thought it was going to be a smooth spread. It's not really a spread...it's more of a chopped up sun dried tomatoes with other ingredients. The taste is also ok, I've had much better. The reason for the 1 star is because something that tastes 'just ok' shouldn't be $17.",negative
"I love to use this on eggs, fish, beans, vegetables, etc.  It adds flavor to all of those foods.  It's not too spicy, but quite delicious.",positive
"when i got this in the mail, the nice thing about it was that i ordered one, but they gave me a second one. now i could use the other to give to my sis for her birthday! the taste is of ramune and grape flavor. when mixed together its a sort of a grape soda flavor. really nice and easy to do. my sister enjoyed it when we opened the box and split it between us. just hope she doesn't find out she's gonna try it a second time!",positive
I love the fresh taste and the nutritional punch of these pepitas.,positive
"Super fun, great taste and perfect idea to top ice cream!",positive
All flavors were distinguishable and tasted so good and natural,positive
"I've been hunting for this since I had it in a hotel in Japan and asked the chef for the recipe. He simply turned around and showed me part of the label in Japanese. Finding this is fantastic. Like on other reviewer said I could drink this stuff, actually when the first shipment arrived I ""poured"" me a shoot and really drank it. Yes it is really that good.",positive
Prompt delivery. Excellent quality.,positive
Great gravy mix.,positive
Bread crumbles apart,negative
"Mine were shipped quickly and arrived quickly. Great packaging, no mold!I opened them and the smell was heavenly!! Great quality and nice sized beans! I have them soaking in White Rum. I cannot rate the flavor as I haven't tried them yet. I'm pleased with the looks and smell of the product.",positive
"We love the flavor of the coffee, but it didn't come in the burlap sac as pictured. Otherwise it arrived quickly and the packaging was secure. We will order again.",positive
The description of the product on the website says it’s made with passion fruit concentrate.  The actual bottle description says something different and it tastes nothing like passion fruit.,negative
Use about a tablespoon in my Fairlife chocolate protein drink everyday for my mid-morning pick-me up.Gives it a rich mocha taste.,positive
"Coffee is my favorite drug and the first 2 cups in the morning better wake me up. This is one of my favorites to enjoy first thing every day.  It's strong, smooth, and doesn't upset my stomach because it's not bitter. I usually get bored with the same coffee after a while, but this one never lets me down.  Enjoy.",positive
This coffee is quite delicious and one of the few Starbucks offerings that are Organic.  The problem with the Amazon sellers is that this coffee is $13.95 a pound at Starbucks.That is quite a bit less than the Amazon offerings....,positive
Great product! Not too spicey.,positive
Coffee was the best ice cold. A little pricey though.,positive
These are very good. Just be careful with children because they can slide off the stick. I love these because the shape is smooth and doesn’t make your tongue sore like some hard candies do. I will definitely but these again!,positive

Arrived spoiled and leaking.,negative
Perfect.  Delivered safely.,positive
I bought it for my Mom and she absolutely loved it !!!,positive
"I purchased 2 packages of these at a local grocery store. They are impossible to use. All of them tore miserably when trying to delicately  separate them from their plastic sheet. The ones that weren't completely useless disintegrated the moment a filling was added to it. If you microwave them (per package instructions) they turn sticky and rubbery and tear more, If you heat them gently (again, per package instructions) they turn into a cracker in an instant. If you use them without heating, they are grainy and unpleasant. I haven't run across a product so terrible in a long time. Out of the 20 I purchased (2 packs of 10), I got 3 crepes that weren't torn beyond use, and those became mush the moment I added some strawberries to them. Total waste of time and money.",negative
It's brown sugar pop tarts in a large quantity. What's not to love?,positive
"Very watery, more like soup, and also very bland.  Was not able to eat it after a few hesitant bites and threw it away.",negative
The best coffee I have ever tasted. I am so hooked on this coffee that I can't drink anything else.....Ever.,positive
Great bold taste for a very reasonable price!,positive
I feel great after adding this to my daily routine! I can tell when I miss a day. I have noticed clearer skin and better immunity as a side perk! The best wheat grass around (and good luck trying to find a better price),positive

"I went on a water fast for 12 days, and used the sea moss to still get the nutrients I needed without consuming food. After soaking and refrigerating it 12+ hours, I blended it into a really loose gel consistency and added a tablespoon to my water every morning. I believe the sea moss helped me not experience the detox symptoms such as headaches.",positive

"They are like I remember growing up in France, perfect to snack on and tiramisu",positive
Cashews arrived on time and were very fresh. Great for sauces and desserts.,positive

"I first saw this at Sam's, but walked by it.  Saw it again here and figured I'd give it a try.Water in a can?  Maybe someone thought it would keep in colder longer? Whatever the reason, the can gave the water some odd taste.  I washed the top, thinking maybe that was the issue: Nope!Sorry but the gimmicky name is interesting, the product is not.",negative
"90 calories, tasty, and satisfying",positive
"I don't review to many products because most of them disappoint me. This chipolte is unlike any other I have had. I can add it to my pintos or any other dish and it gives it this unique smokey flavor and makes me think there is bacon in my food when there isn't. It is difficult being vegan and not going back to meats. This product gives me that flavor profile of meats when mixed with certain beans. It is extremely hot for some people, but a small amount will go a long way.",positive
"This is what I eat instead of chips... Those are very unhealthy... I love this, it's super tasty. I don't find it fishy at all.",positive
Buying in bulk is the way to go. I have been enjoying this wonderful blend for weeks now. I am going to re-purchase soon. I do not want to run out of this awesome flavor coffee.

I just tried this and I’m hooked!Spritzly hits the spot,positive
"The Passion Fruit Black Tea smells lovely; it's like aromatherapy before drinking it. It's pretty in color. I love the flavor; it's not sweet, but can be drunk without sugar. I like it hot, not too sweet but I also enjoy it steeped double strength and sweet over ice. I love that there's nothing I'm allergic to re. oranges, like in so many fruit teas. I plan to buy more, plus other flavors. I also like the fact that some of the proceeds go back into the community to help inner-city youth. It's just a small way I can put my tea vice dollars into a worthy cause",positive
Love sugar daddy’s grew up on them,positive
I felt so sick after preparing by directions. May as well drink melted coconut oil,negative

These are plump and moist and have very good pear flavor. They are well packaged and they arrived promptly. It's a huge bagful. I guess the only thing close to a downside is now I have more pears than I really need, but I'm sure they'll be eaten pretty quickly.  :)",positive
"Ordered this for my nieces and nephews for halloween, they loved it!",positive
"After trying this coffee because of it's reasonable price, I now buy it consistently about once a month.  It has a smooth, even bodied finish.  It's never bitter, but it is strong enough to stand up to creamer. I love it.  I recently acquired a Keurig, and I ordered refillable filter cups just so I can continue to use this brand.",positive
This Coffee is so smooth and Delicious I cant get enough. I am addicted to Coffee from Puerto Rico. In my Opinion they have some of the best coffee on this side of heaven.,positive

"This is a delicious and hearty chili, just the right amount of beans and meat and not too watered down. It is pretty mild so adding some jalapenos and hot sauce was a must for me.",positive
"I usually go through the long process of making my own sauce, staying away from bottled sauce which I have tried all available.  However, Hoboken Farms makes the best sauce ever.  I will be buying again and again.  I love this stuff.",positive

It's great coffee and works great in my Keurig coffee maker with the refillable pods. AND it saves me a ton of money by not purchasing the packaged pods.,positive

This coffee smells and tastes sooo good! I was really surprised that it actually tasted like it smells.,positive
The cereal tasted altered and was so disgusting we had to though all the boxes away.,negative
Not all that great. Half of jar was broken pieces.  Just is not as good as other brands.,negative
This honey has a unique flavor and can be used in recipes or just out of the jar!  I learned about the great health properties which encouraged me to pay the rather hefty price but well worth it.  The large jar is $75 but it will last a fairly long time.,positive
"I've had chocolate delivered prior but this company packed the chocolate in a very well padded box with two cold packs to ensure the candy would not melt in transit. Definitely recommend, and will purchase again. Well done!",positive

I used it in an Indian cooking dish. Very good.,positive
We eat this in Christmas time in my country of origin.  It is originally from Italy but the Italian community is very large.  I'm so happy I can now continue my tradition here in America.,positive
"I would give negative stars for this product, if it were possible! Gum was hard as a rock. Other than the red cinnamon chicklets, you could not distinguish one flavor from another. The ""candy shell"" on 50% of the chicklets was chipped, as you can see in the attached photo. I should never have purchased something that could not be returned if product was damaged. I will not make the same mistake again!",negative
"Nice creamy mild flavor, excellent for relaxing. Will not push you back to work however.....",positive
I love the taste and the bottles are great because they don't spill easily.  I wash them out and use them as water bottles even though the top is not covered.,positive
Great product and this choice was the best price.,positive
"These are great fig and olive crisps!  They are a wonderful snack and very crispy. They have many healthy beneficial ingredients in them, and I have noticed improved energy and other benefits which I won't discuss as not everyone may experience them, but I would highly recommend them and give it about a week, and you just may notice improvement in your day-to-day activities.",positive
"Best root beer on the market. Nice smooth taste from start to finish. I’ve tried many kinds, and nothing beats Mug. The price here on Amazon is very expensive.",positive

"My first FFL plant. I wanted it to be our new it  plant in our new home. It arrived in a beat up box,  leaves were folded in half and leaves had brown spots. I contacted the growers and got instructions on care but 2 weeks later... there are more brown spots forming on the underside of the leaves. I suggest you buy locally.",negative
"I bought a teaspoon of these 1 year and eleven months ago, i was dissapointed with the recieved item, but little did i know all it needed was a little bit of TLC...After about a week of caring for them i had about a cup of strong, extremly healthy kefir grains (actual popcorn size) and was really impressed and surprised with this product... after 2 months i had so many i couldnt keep up with them even after leaving them in the fridge to slow their metabolism i was overwelmed with kefir grains...love this product and thinking of ordering some more...",positive

Great almond butter!,positive
Love Cherchies products!  Delivery was quick and product was carefully packaged.,positive
Very delicious but way too expensive.,negative
"Bought these after reading several reviews and watching a few videos on how to make my own vanilla. They smell wonderful, felt like they had a good moisture content, and cut fairly easily. Looking forward to tasting in a few months!",positive
I bought this product while searching for organic coconut oil for my hair. The price was great for this size compared to others. It works very well in my hair. It's a wonderful daily moisterizer. I am not a fan of it on my skin...for my skin I prefer sweet almond oil. I have also used it in desserts. Pretty flavorful. I'd recommend it.,positive
Brought back good memories of 60 years ago!  WIll do business again !,positive

Whole family loved them,positive
Everything tasted amazing,positive
this different chocolate is so tasteful,positive
"How do you make something hat taste great even better, add a egg! You’re welcome",positive
"WARNING!  These pine nuts are so darned good that you'll end up eating far more than you should! I did!  It's very difficult to limit consumption so I'd strongly recommend them on salads and other foods but try to your hand out of the bag.  All kidding aside, these were absolutely excellent.",positive
I mixed this in with a tomato sauce to add a subtle cheesy-garlicky flavor. Worked great! Will do this again!!,positive
"It tells you you won't get what's pictured but a random 20. I like the flavors I got and I got it on sale. Would not pay full price for the small bars. The melon, strawberry and coffee ones were the best but all had better flavor than the American ones. Thier white chocolate one was better than the American one. Fun to try",positive
Very flavorful. Easy to prepare,positive
Good product.  I love it.,positive
Great taste and good for when cooking is not an option. Just heat and eat.,positive
"The powder was spilled inside the bag, half empty containers, clumpy powder in containers, and a really sour taste. Not what they used to sell at Dollar Tree",negative
This tuna is delicious but now for same price you only get 12 cans not 24cans,negative

These tomatoes are perfect and stayed fresh for a long time. Yummy yummy yummy. I'll definitely continue by the tomatoes from Amazon.,positive
Our chocolates all arrived to us melted and stuck together.  We were not able to share them or eat them!,negative
"I’ve read and ignored the reviews, this was the best hot sauce I’ve ever tried. Perfect amount of sweetness, followed by a punch of heat. I put this on literally everything. I’ve tried all of the sauces and none have failed me. In fact I’m actually dabbing the white truffle sauce into my mouth as I write this. Let’s face it, it’s definitely pricey. I’d beat up a middle schooler to lower the price by a buck or two myself. If you’re just looking for something to try and explore this is that product. If you do",positive
All flavors taste like cinnamon there is no difference in flavors. I had high hopes especially with the pecan pie flavor but they all tasted the same.,negative
"I bought it to celebrate month anniversary with my spouse and it is so great, especially for the price. One of the challenge options was to bake cookies without looking recipes and we had so much fun together. Totally recommend it.",positive
I like all the flavors and the price,positive
My husband and I did not like this tea.  It is weak o the blueberry flavor and has a musty taste.  I do not like the metal container as it doesn’t fit where I keep my teas.  I was very disappointed with this tea.,negative
"Received this yesterday, and today, everyone in my family tried it.  It tasted REALLY awful.  I would never, ever buy this product again.  I'm honestly shocked it has so many good reviews.  I don't know if we got a bad batch or what, but it was downright disgusting.  I couldn't even drink half of it before dumping it out.",negative
Tastes great and is smooth!,positive
Great creamy chicken soup. This kind tastes better than the original.,positive
Product arrived on time and is what I wanted. Enjoy it in my morning coffee.,positive
this is some of the best hot chocolate that i have had.  tastes like what my mom used to mske for me.,positive
Best coffee on the market.Pamper yourself.,positive
If you don’t have these get them now they’re life changingly good,positive
These mints were for a party.  They were old tasting and old looking.  They had a whitish haze over them.,negative
Ok so I haven’t had a pop tart in a really long time just because the ingredients are just no good . But these taste really good and are filling . Try the apple flavor it’s just as good 😊.,positive

This is a convenient product that will beeasily available when needed especiallywhen preparing for wintery snowed-in daysmaking it an accessible addition whenpreparing ahead.,positive

Love these candies. I get them every year for Christmas!,positive
Very good coffee very fresh my husband love it lm going to buy it again,positive
Very good ristretto but you only get a fraction out of your investment the way the capsules are designed the problem they do not allow to release the pressure at the right moment coffee comes out of the top and spills all over your dolce gusto coffee makers. I have three different coffee makers and they don’t work with any of them. All original Nes Café capsules work it’s no problem be careful Buying other than original,negative
Love these bars. Good and good for you. No rancid oils or added sugars. When the website says sold out. Order from amazon 😜,positive
5 of the 6 cans have large dents and can't be used.,negative
"This stuff is very different than you would expect. I can taste the essence of the pickled plums and some very different nuances. I was a bit appauled by the taste when I put it on a spoon and tasted it. Very salty and astringent, but when I started using a bit in the place of soy sauce, when cooking. I really liked the results. Put a dash in your Udon or miso soupand you will see what I mean. Just don't taste it on a spoon.",positive
"I love mochi!! Thank you for selling it, great quality!",positive
It just tasted like regular mediocre salsa. It didn’t taste tropical in the slightest.,negative
"This is a great tasting product.  There is no weird after taste and it lends a more natural flavor than Splenda packets.  I use this to sweeten my tea and I wanted to mention that the longer it sits in the fridge, the better it tastes.  So I make my tea and usually start drinking it the next day.  If I didn't know any better, I would think it had real sugar in it!",positive
"My new go-to coffee! I love the great, smooth flavor, and I do not get as jittery with it as I do with coffee. It's a wonderful balance. And the cacao nibs make the cup a bit euphoric :)",positive
I placed my order for these chips on 2/10/22. I received them on 2/12/22 with all of the box being out of date and priced much less than I actually paid for them. Unable to return and haven’t been able to get through for a refund. What a waste of money!,negative
Quick for on the go!  Good side bags,positive
This is perfect for the crispy fried pork belly I cooked. Great product I would order again.,positive

This is really good. Fresh tender and tasty. I think it somewhere between summer sausage and a Slim Jim. I will definitely buy again.,positive
Very pleasant experience,positive
"Tastes good, especially when you add your own ingredients to it. Does have a slight spice to it.",positive
"Perfect size for snacking. Great for kids lunches, and to have in car for a snack, We like they are roasted, good flavor",positive
I love it and have already recommended to friends and family,positive
A hard to fine product. I use it in baking,positive
Love pulparindo! So tasty! 4 boxes for a great price. Fast delivery. Will definitely recommended. I will be reordering soon!,positive
Reminds me of granny's house!,positive
"REVIEW UPDATE (10/14/2022): I am amazingly disappointed that the manufacturer has not fixed this problem. If I were selling these I would stop immediately until a solution is provided by the manufacturer. I bought these 24 times, 2 boxes of 6 at a time until I finally gave up. I have some boxes left from my orders so I bought a weighting scale here on Amazon. It was not expensive. So now I can weigh the broken pieces of the equivalent of what I want to eat as cookies. Pretty pathetic. Looking for another brand going forward. I don't think the manufacturer of this product cares about fixing the problem, which is a real shame. The good news is the scale works real well and perhaps will come in handy for cooking, etc.These graham crackers are absolutely delicious and I love the taste. However, the makers are in desperate need of a packaging overhaul. The crackers are fragile and no matter how well the outside case (of 6 boxes) is made, the damage happens inside every box. You can't tell this from looking at the outside packaging at all. Every box of 12 crackers looks fine on the outside. The actual packaging problem in inside the individual boxes. The crackers are loosely contained in a hard plastic tray with 6 crackers in two compartments. The plastic tray is covered by a foil wrapper. When you open the foil the cookies have shifted. They have enough room to move not only up and down but turn over and shift between the two compartments. During this movement they probably hit each other enough to crack into pieces. I think the packaging needs a redesign, not the ""new look"" as sometimes marketing states to the box. Other cracker brands do not smash like this as their packaging has been designed properly. Other than that, great tasting cookies.",negative
"Great flavor, and as some have mentioned, they can be hard and rock like but I like them that way, so. Do with that what you will.",positive
"It’s so creamy , not too sweet , it’s perfect ! Delicious ! Iam so glad I founded it ! Thanks ! 👍😊❤️",positive
"After a long long couple days of working, it was sitting at my door. Just in time for my online biology exam. Let me tell you, the feeling of being alive after feeling dead for days was amazing. Great product!",positive
I like homemade tapioca pudding for dessert.,positive
This is stupid expensive.  You can get keto friendly bread at almost any large grocery chain for 6 or 7 bux a loaf.  I would venture to say that Amazon has greater buying power than any of them.  This is ridiculous price gouging.,negative
bought for some one else but she loved it,positive
It's Honey Nut Cheerios.  Why do you need a review?,positive
"These are not only super healthy but taste great; very similar to a traditional, thin cut potato chip. I'm a big fan.",positive
So nice that I can get it next day. Love this flavor.,positive
I am very upset when I received the product which was open and non refundable.  I pad for a product that I am not able to use.,negative
"...because this was simply awful. 101 Dalamatians was funny even if formulaic, but this is nothing more than puerile drivel. The same plot except with the story excised from it; the world's most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw; Tim McInnerny proving that he really can't do comedy (everone remembers Percy in Blackadder but that was his high spot - it's all been downhill since then); direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you'd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again - properly this time. Ieuan Grufford better go back to Hornblower sharpish, whilst Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several years.Perhaps I could be too harsh; after all I didn't manage to sit through the whole film. It gets 1/10; only because I can't give it 0.",negative
"Received product Dec 18 or 19, and per packaging this product expiration date was 19Sept2021.",negative
When I opened it up it was spoiled,negative
Love this product. Most bone broth is barely palatable. This one is pricey but well worth it.,positive
It was not handed directly to a resident! Don’t lie please!!,negative
The cake looked so cute and was a huge hit at the party. Just know these are rice paper and taste like cardboard though (NOT made of sugar).,positive
Very satisfied..I stayed making homemade vanilla chai latte...n love that there were more tea bags then store.. The ingredients help my psoriatic arthritis.. Cinnamon n ginger.. Thanks,positive
"These chocolates are sold as dark chocolate but they do have milk in the ingredients list. I did not find these as dark as I would like but they still have a very nice flavor, they are close to milk chocolate in flavor.",positive
"I thought I'd save some money and buy a bigger quantity of my favorite soft drink. Little did I know that the plastic bottle wouldn't allow the soda to deliver the same punch of flavor that the glass bottles do. I'm sure there's science behind this, but don't suffer the plastic folks, get the glass and enjoy your beverage as it's intended.",negative
Not big on flavor. Rather plain and forgettable.,negative
Amazon is the only place that gives you this much variety with k cups at a affordable price.,positive
I liked the taste and convenience that this product provides. Great for smoothies anytime.,positive
Just what we needed: a quality spice at a good price!,positive
Will buy this again and again,positive
"Love the product! ""Good deal,I will definitely order again from this seller..",positive
No idea what kind of wheat this is but it won't proof when used in my recipes.,negative

Gluten free. Easy to cook. Add veggies and eggs for an easy meal. Great tadte,positive
I'm very sensitive to caffeine and have tried other decaf coffees that I've found still affected my nerves.  I've experienced the least amount of caffeine effects with this coffee and it tastes great too!,positive
Looks like this product wasn't stored properly. Jelly beans stick together and form large globs. Definitely not worth the money. Contacted the seller and no response.,negative
Put two in apple cider vinegar and made a ridiculous spicy pepper vinegar!  Great for fermenting!,positive
This product was as advertised and was shipped promptly!,positive
Vpgreat product for the price,positive

Good luck .. Beware ...,positive
"Great value for citric acid, at least in my limited use/knowledge of price.  We primarily use citric acid to run a cleaning cycle in our dishwasher to remove any funky odors, etc.The first time I purchased citric acid on Amazon I paid ~$8.00 for half a pound.  When it was time to purchase again I came across this brand that was priced at ~$13.00 for 5 pounds.While I have not done a detailed comparison they seem to be equally effective and I don't find any reason to think this stuff is any lower quality than the more expensive purchase.",positive
Almost flavorless which allows you to add your own flavor to them. Great if you're watching what you eat but need different texture and miss pastas / rice,positive
Awesome! Good Price! Fast Delivery!,positive
"Love it, coffee without being giggy. It's a healthy brew you can drink any time of day",positive
"Bought these as a gift for my Mother, who watches her sugar; and she loves them.  She eats a handful or two daily and satisfies her cravings for candy or sugar.",positive
Clean. I like it.,positive
This is one of my favorite flavors. they came very quickly.,positive
"Not too much coconut flavor, it is perfect!",positive
I have always used sunflower oil to make bread. It is next to impossible to find at any local grocery stores for a reasonable price anymore. A lot of it used to be imported from Ukraine but has stopped. I bought this after reading reviews. It is good quality and contributes to a great loaf of whole wheat bread!,positive
Not happy with this tincture. It did nothing. I have used for several weeks and still nothing. I’m a light weight when it comes to all meds natural or pharm. still nothing finished the bottle and guess what nothing. I’m a practicing herbalist and all I can say is I had such high hopes but this products completely failed. To me it’s either too diluted or the herbs are shelved for far too long loosing their potency... not happy for the price point and what it didn’t deliver.,negative
Easy to cook with while staying keto.,positive
I was very disappointed when I removed the bubble wrap from the jar. The jar had broken and you could tell it had been broken a while. Very disappointed and will not order again!,negative
These are very fresh.  Which is important when you don’t have the salt on them.  The flavor is excellent.  Overall a very good product and price.,positive
Smaller and less developed than advertised. I purchased one before so this was an unfortunate surprise.,negative
Tastes great and works good on those hot days.,positive
As advertised.  All is good. Not a complaint.,positive
"This is a very concentrated powdered Roobios.  When I first saw the can I thought it was such a small amount.  But you only need a tiny amount to make a cup - like 1/8 tsp.  If you use more than that, it is too strong.  It is very tasty and if you like Roobios, and don't want to bother with a tea bag this is a good one.  It doesnt have caffeine so you can drink it late at night.",positive
Best coffee ever.. I am turning so many people onto this coffee... all flavors are excellent and if you use creamer you don’t need hardly any..,positive
Packaged well and the best price on Amazon.,positive
I was so excited to find these.  I had been looking for de-caf flavored coffee in the stores and couldn't find them.  These taste great for a good price. They was exactly what I was looking for,positive
"Can't say I was too impressed.  Very chewy, with a texture in the mouth like chewing fresh coconut chunks, only the taste was not as interesting.  Spouse and I consumed maybe 1/4 cup and threw the rest out.  I do not doubt that it is healthier than real nuts, but I don't expect this to catch on much.  But I am glad I tried it at least.",negative
"We've been buying our wild rice for years at a popular chain (hint--shrubs shaped like monkeys swinging in the trees), but now that chain only sells wild rice from September through March, according to a manager there.Our whole family loves wild rice with roasted turkey or chicken, and with lamb stew.  So, gave this brand a try.  Costs only slightly more per pound than at the hip chain-store.I think it has a rich, nutty flavor, and it has a classic wild-rice texture and fragrance.Our 5 lb. bag was very strong, sealed plastic, and it was well packed with air-pillows.I'm not surprised by how many people seem to know very little about wild rice.  We stopped eating it for years because the price had gone crazy in big grocery stores.  So, of course younger shoppers might never have tried it--or had it just at a few holidays where it might have been overcooked or otherwise not done right.Very glad to have this option to enjoy affordable wild-rice.Oh--and it is high in fiber, really helpful for digestion.  Don't need raisin bran on days you eat this!  Works GREAT!",positive
Great value and these are really good fresh beans!,positive
"Ghee butter is great for getting a butter flavor on foods that cook at a higher heat. I really like it for getting a good sear on a steak, or sauteing veggies. Some people who have issues with dairy can have this stuff with no problems. This brand is high quality with no fillers.",positive
I bought for my wife and she loves them. Fast delivery too,positive
Flavor was lacking texture was horrible.,negative
"Love it, when we can afford it!",positive
What I disliked?The bottle was broken when the driver brought it out—I want to order another bottle of course and not be charged,negative

Had these a few years back when visiting Japan. Was surprised to see I could order it Amazon. These are so much better than Gatorade or Powerade.,positive
Very consistent reliable black tea bags. Good flavor. Brews well. Can't ask for muxh more.,positive
"I wish I had asked re: the expiration date; foolish me.  I assumed it would be a reasonable time, but for my huge 4 lb 12 oz can, it's less than 6 months!!!  Definitely NOT a good buy for a single person who would drink 16 oz per day.",negative
"What a waste of time and money! My hubby and I saw this movie - after seeing the previews and thinking it ""might be funny"". WRONG! This movie is about 90 minutes too long. The actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can't get out. The jokes are weak and tired, and not even seeing Wilson's naked behind can redeem any part of this film. The special effects.....aren't. I half expected to see the harness and wires holding up Uma in her flying scenes. And when the effects people apparently could not master the superhero's faster-than-a-speeding-bullet flying or fight scenes, they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen - which hid the awful effects quite nicely. Wilson's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his office co-worker. The sex scenes weren't sexy and the funny scenes weren't funny. I guess I just expected too much from these actors. None of the characters were really sympathetic, so I ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them. The only memorable performances were the kids who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least THEY had some chemistry. Overall, a super stinko movie - I wouldn't even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!",negative
"I was a little nervous when ordering this, but this product is absolutely wonderful. It is so good, the fudge melts in your mouth. I will order again!!",positive
I use pink Himalayan salt for everything I need it on.,positive
I love this salt. It is flavorful and natural. It's the way to go.,positive
I didn't think I liked Green tea until I tried the matcha frappacino at the local coffee house. I found the recipe on line and use this now to make my own. Seems like very good quality for a great price.,positive
A bit expensive but it does have a great nutty taste. Perfect to make a struesel with instead of high calorie graham crackers,positive
"We have been buying this coffee for over a year and have liked it very much.  However the latest order , a buy again, the same box but the individual cups are pink instead of white. And the taste is definitely off. To us it has a hint of being sour.  We are returning our 4 box order and now afraid to buy again.",negative
"For reference, I’ve been drinking Twinings Earl Grey tea since I was 5. This compares to that so well that it could honestly be the same thing. The leaves look great, the smell is just as phenomenal as I’m used to, the taste is perfect. Good sized bag for the price I think. Very pleased with this and glad I’ve tried it. I likely won’t buy again as I get my earl grey in bulk for a Very low price, but I absolutely intend to look into other teas from this company! I judge my tea brands on their earl grey, and this one has impressed me enough to try more.Highly recommend!",positive
Wasn't sure what I was getting when ordering this item but was pleasantly surprised and the pack of flavor this adds to my soups.  I have to try cooking low sodium for my hubby and we both were super pleased with this product.  Would recommend it to everyone.,positive
I grew up eating cinnamon toast in the morning  or evening. As my mother was from southern England. This cinnamon adds a little punch and it’s good for your digestion.,positive
"OMG!!  These came today and I was really anxious to see what a broth with 'taste' would be liked.  I have only tried the Tomato Basil so far - excellent! Spicy with peppery undertones, but not ""hot"".  Definitely a life saver. I have gastric bypass surgery on July 13. Today was the first day I started the liquid diet for 2 weeks pre-op, and  broth was one of the options.  It breaks up the sweetness of the protein shakes and popsicles and jello.  Sipping broth....okay.  But can't say I sipped it.  I'm not used to being on only liquids, so I have to say I sort of chewed and savored it!  THANK YOU for creating this sipping broth.  Wish there were more flavors, but looking forward to checking out the other flavors.Order this if you want some broth that doesn't taste like a cotton ball!!!",positive
This is delicious coffee.  Perfect for those who love true coffee flavor without bitterness.,positive
I love making this coffee concentrate into an iced caramel.,positive
"Way too sweet sweet for me. Bought them for my boyfriend who also wasn't a fan. Also, not a fan of the cherry flavor personally. Won't buy again.",negative
"Baci-Kiss! I am using these delicious chocolates for wedding favors.  I thought the price for 5lbs of Baci was good and I shopped around.  The shipping was faster than what was estimated (bonus).  The shipping box was a bit beat up and I thought some of the chocolate packages were removed, but happily they were all there.  I am very happy with my purchase and YES I do recommend.",positive
"I drink this when I need an extra boost of energy and don't want to sacrifice taste.  Death Wish coffee is a perfect blend of taste and caffeine .  On the weekend I clean and do laundry, clean fish tanks etc.... Death Wish helps me get my chores done while treating myself to a excellent cup of joe",positive
"This fudge is so good, just like my father used to make. One or two pieces will satisfy your sweet tooth because of how rich the taste is. Really good fudge.",positive
"I used this for a cake topper on my son's birthday cake and it was fantastic!  I had to keep the other little boys hands out of the cake because they just wanted to play with the trucks!  Great scale, nice detailing.  We used it on a Costco sheet cake and smashed some toffee for rocks.  It was a big hit!",positive
They where we'll package none of them were broken  love it .,positive
"Great taste, feel great, quick shipping!",positive
Fantastic olives. Great flavor and great for stuffing. Shipped in a hurry and well packed. Would definitely recommend and will buy again,positive
"I just made chicken paprikash with a blend of the Szeged Hot and Sweet Paprika (about a 3 parts sweet to 1 part hot) and it was ""make my nose run"" hot.  So, my son and I decided to see what the Scoville Units of Hot Hungarian Paprika is...well, I couldn't find any specifics, but in my research (which also led me here to read these reviews) I found a few things out.Per the Spice Chain web site: Spice Chain Corporation was formed with the acquisition and combination of Van de Vries Spice Corporation and Spiceco. The two New Jersey based companies were merged in February 2015 and subsequently changed their name to Spice Chain Corporation.I guess some of the reviewers only buy Paprika every four or five years of so if they are just now noticing the can changed (it was white with the red border and a white lid, and now it is this tan with red border and red lid) LOLThe cans of Hungarian Hot and Hungarian Sweet Paprika I have are very good. The Sweet is smokey, and the hot is fiery.  It is as good as I remember it when I was younger.",positive
"My daughter wanted butterflies on her 12th birthday cake and these were so perfect. Honestly, the cake itself was not very pretty but thankfully these totally turned it around. The girls had a lot of fun eating them too.",positive
I ordered this for a 5 year old who has stated she wanted to be an astronaut. I remember getting these as a child but these were so broken up they were closer to dust than actual astronaut ice cream sandwiches. Very disappointed as each child opened at the same time so I'm just out $26 bucks plus what it cost to buy actual ice cream as a replacement.Would advise not to order,negative
Very good yum,positive
"I use herbs and spices in almost everything I cook and my spice rack looks like a tornado blew through. There are all sorts of brands. Round, tall, short, glass, plastic, all sorts of labels make it look like a mess. I would like to organize and streamline. The Watkins Gourmet jars are uniform and look sophisticated. The flavors are rich and bold. You only need a pinch, rub between your plams or fingertips and BAM! Add some spice to your dishes and do it in style. These make fabulous gifts as well!",positive
This look so cute and full in the photo. When they arrived there were some that had only a few strands on them. They shed terribly and look awful because the strands are so sparse. Apparently they are not eligible for a return so definitely would not buy.,negative
"Love these gluten free crackers. They are hard to find in my local Wegmans but found on Amazon. Packed nicely, don't come crumbled like from Walmart. Rhey are a bit crumbly when you eat them so be prepared but they ALMOST taste like saltines... Enjoy!",positive
"I was so looking forward to these arriving.  I have never heard of or tried salmon chips and I was not disappointed.. These are a healthy alternative and for some could be an acquired taste, but I really loved it. It had amazing crunch and the bbq was an interesting addition. The bags are a perfect size IMO and although it’s pricey I would totally buy these again. I’m interested to see what other flavors for salmon chips are available and if they make a standard/plain one.My partner said they were ok but he personally wouldn’t buy them again. So taste is subjective. I love trying new healthy snacks and I’ll glad I got these.  If you’re not adventurous and are just looking for standard run of the mill bbq chips look elsewhere.",positive
My order was to have 6 items but I only received 1 item today.  Please check to let me know when to expect the rest of my order.,negative
Really wanted to like these but the flavor just isn't agreeable unfortunately.,negative
"Love this flavor, taste great with orange juice!",positive
*Excellent Seller* Great Cheese that makes an awesome pizza!!  Love It!!  Well packed with ice packs + Lightning Fast Delivery!!! A++ thank You!!,positive

This product expired 7 months ago. How can Amazon condone such practices.  I would like Amazon to refund “TWICE THE AMOUNT” to their customers when ever their vendors breach this trust... Please Refund!!!,negative
Love it! Like a pot roast in a spoon!,positive
Pecans so hard that you could break a tooth easily.  They  tasted burned. very disappointed.,negative
"Normally I try to buy mango dried without sugar.  It's sweet enough already.  I ordered this bag mistakingly which I'll assume responsibility for.  HOWEVER, there is so much sugar added to the mango that you can barely taste the fruit.  This has the texture of candied fruit you add to fruitcake.  I've had other dried mango with sugar added to it that was fine but this is WAY overdone.  I would not buy again.",negative
"If coffee gives you heartburn, try this.  You won't be disappointed.  All the good Folger flavor,but  no upset stomach.",positive
"We use quite a bit of sugar free gelatin at our house. It makes a really nice dessert and does not add a lot of calories and adds zero carbs and zero sugar. I like to make either bears or blocks. We are not really fans of traditional gelatin in a bowl.Royal sugar free gelatin tastes exactly the same as the name brand. At our local supermarket Royal costs the same as the supermarket brand, which is nice. Lately I have not been able to find most of the flavors of the name brand stuff and it is super expensive on Amazon. This variety pack is both affordable and makes a lot of bears.Recipe for bears:MixOne box of flavored Royal sugar free gelatin (.3 ounce)Unflavored plain gelatin  (.25 ounce)1/3 cup waterBring to a simmer in a small sauce pan until all the gelatin has dissolved. Remove from heat and use a dropper to fill gummy bear tray. Let set for 10 to 15 minutes until firm.",positive
"One of the bags arrived open in the box and the gummy bears were all over the box.  I had to throw them away, it was a waste of money.",negative
Mild scent. Very fresh and delicious flavor. Great for adding to coffee and spicing up salads and other dishes,positive
tasting good and arrived fast,positive
"If you love gummy bears, try these. They need to come in a bigger bag. I say that only because they are so yummy. I would definitely buy these again.",positive
"only possible complaint.. is pricing.. would love to given an offer for bulk purchasing... other than that...  give these a try, you'll like.. or even love these flavors... I will buy again",positive
came in time as promised.No p[roblem.,positive

Product was open.  I don’t feel safe to use the tea.,negative
"Passion for black licorice passed to me from  mom. Just discovered these licorice ""toffees"", something I had never tried before, and WOW. I'm polishing off the first jar all by myself, highly addictive and reordering now. More licorice flavor than ""twists"" or black jelly bellys, and not overly sweet.",positive
My husband uses it like a condiment on many types of food.,positive
I love them. Just cost a little much.. Thank you,positive
"The flavor is really good, and the heat level is awesome. Upon first trying this i was actually disappointed, it was spicy but it was wasn't THAT spicy. I then proceeded to make several coworkers and family try it and even the smallest little dabs had them sweating and in pain, I then realized that it really is that spicy, I just have a higher than normal tolerance. The trick is to start small and slowly add as much as you need until it hurts you. I now eat this on nearly everything and my goal is to keep going up in the amount I use on food until it no longer affects me, then on to even spicier hot sauces.",positive
I can't wait to use it to make cold sunflower noodles.,positive
"Love this stuff! Coats popcorn nicely. So much better than dumping table salt onto popcorn and having it all sink to the bottom. This stuff gives the popcorn a nice, even, salty coating. Wish I’d discovered this years ago",positive
Me robaron el paquete de nuevo van dos con esta tienen que ponerlo dentro no fuera se los llevan,negative
My candy was very flavorful.  This is the only brand I use for candy.,positive

"It has great flavor, is easy to spread and you will order this product more than once.",positive
Each can = one drink.  Perfect 🤩.,positive
"I don't understand the bad reviews here. I expected not to like this (based on the reviews), but I actually love it. I does not burn my throat as some mention. It has an intense cherry flavor that I really like. It also does not take like artificial sweetener (as some mention). I typically do not drink sodas. I only got this because it was on promo. Now I am going to start buying this regularly.",positive
"I got these for health reasons (male issues) and opened them, as soon as they arrived, and looked into the package to see  pumpkin seeds with an odd appearance. But then, they are sprouted, and then 'fixed' at that point, and shipped, so they wouldn't appear as 'unsprouted,' then, now would they?  They don't taste odd, they just taste good. Not rancid, not weird, just like what you would expect, but with the benefit of having been 'unlocked' by Mother Nature, to enable humans to eat them for all their medicinal/nutritional goodness!  My family likes them, too.",positive
Loved the flavors and consistency but they take up 1/2 of my potassium limit for the day so ant have them anymore 😭,positive
It was what I was missing!!! The umomi!!!,positive
Good heat and flavor!,positive
"honestly I have never left a review on anything Ive bought lol, but let me just say WOW. This works wonders.. ordered on the 27th of January and gained 9 pounds in one week.. it is pricey but I’ve never been able to gain weight so for me these are worth it. On my second box.",positive
"this stuff is MUST HAVE if you are going to make your own homemade ""velveeta"".  Also works GREAT in cheese sauces to keep the cheese from clumping or breaking as it melts.  You can get away with using far less fat in sauces, since you don't need the fat to buffer the protein molecules in the cheese to keep them from clumping.",positive
Love Love Love the taste. Will definitely buy this again.,positive
Smells soooo good brewing.  Taste is smooth and flavorful.  Love it.,positive
Hard to find locally so excited to find here!,positive
Great flavor & used in home beverage supplies.,positive
This was a gift and I would have liked to get a larger package.,positive
"These are great sausages!  I was worried ordering them as It’s hot in Florida and UPS gets to my house late in the afternoon, but they were still frozen upon arrival!",positive
"This is a large and diverse assortment of snacks and I was especially glad to see that it included ""Wise"" brand salted snacks (as they're an East Coast favorite of mine). All of the snacks in my box were fresh and securely packaged. I liked that they covered a wide range of things that satisfied various tastes. The box is very well-packed to fit in a lot of things in a relatively compact space. I think anyone receiving this as a care package would be impressed by the volume and quantity.When considering value, I think about what I'd have to pay not only for the food items included, but also the shipping. If I were to assemble my own box, the items would be more economical, but I'd have to pay about 1/3 of the cost of this box in postage as well as go to the trouble of putting it together on my own. For the effort and shipping costs it saves, this is quite a good value care box.",positive
"Well...it's cumin.  And taste likes cumin.  Lol.  I make lots 'o chili.  And it just easier to have my own ingredients.  And actually, I had this space above my oven that I made an acrylic shelf that hold like 10 of the sized containers of varying spices...so I am a cook...and?  ;-)",positive
Delicious! So good with all food pairings I have tried.,positive
"As other reviewers mentioned, I think I had a spoiled bag. They were wet and mushy. Tossed the bag",negative
"Very cute, you can stick the stick on with these blue dots they give you",positive
The taste is rather hash nothing like the last taste.,negative
Great for ham too,positive
"I bought the large size and it had pieces of green mold in it. threw it away. Thinking maybe I should buy a smaller size. They also had pieces of green mold. I had bought 4 of them, had to throw them all away. All had expiration dates in 2022.",negative
Very tasty. Compared to other brands and this won in flavor and texture.,positive
"Taste like fresh squeezed lemons. No artificial or after taste. And, you can keep it in a cabinet until you open it.",positive
"The flavors are robust!  Raspberry is my favorite, but I have enjoyed each and every flavor.  I am ready to purchase again!",positive
"This peppermint tea is the best tasting tea,tastes just like fresh mint leaves ! Delicious with lemon and honey also …",positive
It’s just so much more flavorful than U.S. version. Worth the wait and price.,positive
"After having porridge in Ireland we are delighted with this and it’s the same brand as we had there. Great on a cold morning, but we often have it for an evening after a long day.",positive
Absolutely one of my favorite teas. First time trying the Republic of Tea and I am so glad i did love this.,positive
"I like to try food that is different and exotic. Even though these chips were over priced, @$11.00 for this little 3.53 oz container, I had to try them. I imagined a light fava bean chip similar to a potato chip. Needless to say, that was not the case. Fava beans in themselves are very hard anyway but if someone is making a chip out of it one would expect them to be , well, like chips. In my opinion, they were as hard as a rock, just what you would expect a fava bean to be like. I could have broken a tooth , that’s the consistency of these fava chips. The salt made them tasty but it couldn’t hide the after taste as if one were eating a mouthful of fava bean flour. I threw a handful into my soup thinking they would get soft and be more enjoyable, they did not get too much softer. I would not buy them again.",negative
Ate them last night. BBQed medium rare. Wow!Great quality meat. I would buy them ASAP.,positive
I love sweet chili sauce. This brand is awesome. Just the right amount of heat.,positive
K-cup coffee has a wonderful flavor and on the strong side. Great morning coffee.,positive

I warm it in the microwave for 25 seconds and I have a warm brownie ... gluten free and I didn't have to bake it.  I'm sold.",positive
i love these candies,positive
Nice smooth flavor.  gallon brew is the way to go!,positive

I love how well they work,positive

Perfection Personified,positive
Very fresh and a wonderful selection,positive

"Looking for alternative to archers farms version, this was not it",negative
EXCELLENT PRODUCTS GREAT FOR PAN SEARED MEATS AND VEGETABLE,positive
Bought these to ween myself off of monster energy. They work well providing the flavor and minor carbonation that I’m used to… they have no caffeine so may cause headaches if you’re following my lead to remove caffeine from your daily.,positive

Allergic to ulcers in mouth due to too much acid in product,negative
"I have purchased this before and LOVE the product. Best flavor, smoothest, richest chocolate. Melts beautifully and covers strawberries well. However, this time the item came completely melted. Both ice packs were melted and had started seeping out on the bag. Put right in fridge now I have a large brick of chocolate. Not the end ofvthe world but slightly frustrating",positive
Best tasting Coffee Ever!!,positive
We only use Karo Corn Syrup at our house.  Our favorite recipe is scotcheroos!!!,positive

I really like the taste of this product. It helps my aches and pain. It soothes my stomach. The cost is so much better than some other products.,positive
"Jane's Krazy Mixed up Salt has managed to combine salty/peppery/flavorful for a completely unique and wonderful flavor. I use it on all sorts of stuff, and have never found that it conflicted with the natural food flavors. This is not often found in local grocery stores, so I get this 12-pack and stock up every few months. A great deal for a good product.",positive
Burnt fat ends. Bit into fat in each piece.,negative
Use this often and its has great flavour. I dont taste an aftertaste and Knowing it's healthy feels good. Will repurchase.,positive

"If you like mustard and mayo separately, you'll LOVE this product!",positive
"I used this to make my own recipe of Cauliflower Roasted Red Pepper Soup. It came out so well. Cauliflower is kind of bland, but with this sauce, curry and other ingredients, it came out so well. I would expect to order this in a five star restaurant. Absolutely wonderful sweet chili sauce, not overly spicy ( thank you for that) and not super sweet. I ordered two massive bottles of this based on the reviews and I thought these were so big it would take me a long time to use both bottles. I never imagined how many dishes I could add this to. For people who want more heat, just add red chili peppers or other peppers. Very good and I plan to use this with my dumplings and other Asian food. So much better than a sweet soy sauce dipping sauce that I was using.",positive
Bought for my nephews and they all love it.,positive
This is my favorite Jones drink.  It’s hard to find at times but good thing Amazon has suppliers. Arrived quick and only lost one bottle in transit.,positive

[[VIDEOID:74d412847e92a90183a5b5a1f829506e]] I was immediately surprised with how large of a bag I received considering the price. I infused a whole bottle of tequila overnight with only 12 flowers. We made margaritas that color change with the pH change and they are magical! Don’t really change the flavor either.,positive
"I unknowingly purchased an entire case, but my family is happy. I've shared with my mother and aunt so it has made the rounds to 3 households and everyone loves it. My grandparents had a farm and if it can pass the taste test of both my mother and aunt it's good. The best part is it's quick and easy.",positive
Great! 🤗,positive

"After following the microwave instructions I tried the salmon.  The sides were okay but the middle was tough and uneatable.  Not sure whether the problem was it was undercooked (even though the vegetables and outer portions of the salmon were fine) or a bad piece of salmon.  But although it is convenient to have an all-in-one microwaveable meal, in this case it didn't work out.",negative
Love these stars. We always had them as kids.  They are delicious!  I was so happy to find them and share with my grand kids.,positive
Very good tea with honey in it,positive
By far the best I have had. I’ve been smoking/grilling meats for about 20 years now and this marinade/sauce enhances the flavor so much it makes me look like a pro come feeding time!,positive
My new favorite snack. Can't get enough.,positive

Ordered Brachs Caramel Apple Mellowcremes on 5/1/23.  Arrived today 5/6 23.  Manufacturers sell by date on package says 7/21/22.  Candy is hard as a rock.  Should have been thrown out a long time ago.,negative
"I ordered these before. The first shipment was fine, but my second one was terrible. Just about every box was poorly sealed. We pretty much threw them all away because the candy were stale and hard. I can only assume this was due to the poorly sealed boxes.  Very disappointing",negative
"These candies are so good! What a great price too! I bought these bags of candies as gifts and everyone who received them thought they were great! I gave out the Frutati Blueberry Yuzu , Pineapple Passionfruit, and Green Apple Mango Hard Candies and I’m so glad everyone enjoyed all the flavors. I tried each these flavors too and they taste so good!Thanks to the sellers for keeping the price just right and for keeping the bags full of candy!I plan to give out more as they were a hit!!God bless and thanks again!! 😊",positive
"I love sparkling water to the point of my husband buying me a Soda Stream for my birthday. I've tried all kinds of flavored waters, and I think most of them are trash. (""Natural"" flavors? Ew.) I only drink Spindrift  and Aura Bora from a can while the rest comes from my beloved Soda Stream.Aura Bora is my favorite water ever. It is so smooth and so delicious.For awhile, I talked myself out of spending over $2 a can for this delightful dance in my mouth, but you know what? I should enjoy my time on this earth. If spending far too much on really damn good sparkling water is my vice, then so be it.Basil Berry is my favorite, closely followed by the Cactus Rose. I also really loved the Ginger Lemon. Alas, that was limited and is now gone. Hopefully they'll bring it back.",positive
"I like the contents of the box. Product is exactly as advertised with no defects. If you like Total cereal already, or would like to try some, I recommend this product.",positive
This is some yummy stuff.  I have used the Jiffy brand for more than 40 years and it has never let me down.  Smaller package for a smaller portion or mix two or three boxes together for lots of yumminess.,positive

"I recently had to switch to a vegan and gluten free diet. I'm so happy this ice cream exists. There are several good vegan ice creams, however, this is the first vegan and gluten free ice cream that is actually good. I highly recommend it.

"A little dry, not fresh. Very disappointed in the taste and flavor.",negative
"Happy wife, happy life. Personally, I don't care for it - but she loads her coffee up with sugar and cream, so it takes a strong brew to deliver any coffee taste. I drink my coffee unsweetened & black, so I find it a little bitter.",positive

Best in smoothies I hardly notice it. I’ve also mixed it in water and juice and it really isn’t bad. It won’t dissolve fully but it’s a nice subtle flavor.,positive
Great product....will purchase again.,positive
"I started giving my children the Instant Breakfast along with their regular meals and multivitamins for an extra burst of calories, vitamins, minerals, and protein. To my children, it is simply chocolate milk that Dad doesn't argue with them about when they request it, though my 6yr old has begun proudly flexing and referring to it as her protein milk.",positive
Purchased though Amazon Fresh. I loved these! The steam bag makes for a quick and easy pasta. There were a few( like 3) Noodles that didn't cook as well as the others and were hard but no biggie. These are really good for gluten free pasta!,positive
Very good and will purchase again.,positive
"I have enjoyed these chocolates from my local grocer. Unfortunately, the ones I got from Amazon were clearly not stored properly. They arrived with chocolate bloom, which gave them a white chalky coating and a grainy dried out texture.  Not very palatable! I’d return them if I could, but the return policy won’t allow me to. I’d recommend purchasing these elsewhere.",negative
Disgusting flavor as if expired and all my bottles came TAPED UP TO EACHOTHER. SO ANNOYING! Get real boxes for packaging!! And stop selling expired juices!!!!!!!,negative
"Perfect for an office prank: I work in an office where the supervisors like to run their mouth and say how unproductive we are due to talking too much but themselves can talk all they want.  After reading the reviews I decided to purchase some of these bad boys. Upon arrival  through the mail I took theses cute little irresistible bears to work and placed them in a bowl in my desk that the two supervisors frequently grab from.  I warned my friends as I did not want disaster for them.  The supervisors began their journey through the red and green bears and eventually a few oranges and yellow.Now to the real story, these supervisors are usually talking so much crap and have diarrhea of the mouth but now the tables have turned.  It wasn't but 7 minutes into their gorging feast of Gummy bears the first one immediately started groaning and sharting and began running to the restroom.  Another supervisor immediately followed with violent flatulence resulting in poo running down the leg.  After it was all done with (1.5 hours later) they came out of the bathroom and had to take leave for the rest of the day.  As most of us kept our ear to the door while they were In the rest room, all we could hear was profanity, prayers, and poo splattering on walls and floor.My co workers and I are most happy with the purchase, we just hate that our poor janitor is only 12 and had to clean that mess up.",positive
"These taste great, and are an incredible deal in bulk!",positive
Best extract on the market.,positive
"I put this on just about everything.  Salads, pasta, omelets, french fries.  It's great and a little goes along way.",positive
"Even though it says they come in a ""bag"", they do not.  They are as pictured - a bunch of little boxes in the cardboard shipping box.  Since they are not in a bag, there is no expiration date and the candy was very stale.  I'm guessing it is old. I was very disappointed and will not order in this way again.",negative
I brought these to work and let coworkers try them with me. I personally am pretty sensitive to artificial sugars and I could really taste them in all of the flavors. The only one I finished was the cinnamon crunch one. A coworker took the chocolate ones and somewhat enjoyed them. I tasted every flavor and there wasn’t a single one I would want to purchase again.,negative
"These come in nice package and seem to be everything I was looking for except they taste terrible. I’ve tried a lot of honey, I’m sort of obsessed with it since having my last baby 2 years ago. Anyway, this tastes fine until the after taste and I can’t really put my finger on what the after taste is but it’s not good. I’m not sure I will ever use this bag and I normally go through a bag every month or two.",negative
Do not taste how I remember them... They're nasty but rating is only from my personal taste. Otherwise they came as pictured and described but they're GROSS!!,negative
Great !! Love the results,positive
I absolutely love this coffee!  I am a huge fan of hazelnut coffee in general.  But to find a decaf coffee that doesn't taste weak or full of chemicals is a huge plus.  I highly recommend it!,positive
"These arrived whole not broken. They are delicious, low calorie and good value",positive
I am sorry to say that the last two bags of my favorite butter Popcorn Jelly Bellys are all stale. The previous order of these was great but these are all pretty bad. Very stale and very disappointing.,negative
I don’t know what I would have done without them when I did whole 30! They are very light in flavor but low on calories!,positive
"I use this for shakes, pancakes, waffles, etc. It is a great topping without all the extra calories.",positive
pretty darn good for sugar free!,positive
Its like sugar but not sugar..,positive
"All of the items are just thrown in a box, smashed and for what you get it's not worth the money!",negative
"I can't eat these. Like most people of Cajun descent,  I'm allergic to FD&C #5 yellow dyeWhich this product contains.",negative
"These bars are by far the most delicious keto friendly bar. My whole family, including our picky 10 year old have enjoyed these. Great variety pack, will be reordering.",positive
"I should read the description better. buyer beware -- this is a small bag, maybe will get five servings from it",negative
"This was what I couldn’t find elsewhere, they are great.",positive
"Healthy plants, look good and fit easily in vase. They come with plant food.",positive
Difficult to eat as flavor is unusual and I'm vegetarian,negative
Delicious and real natural!!,positive
"Not bad, great for coffee",positive
I love that Hershey makes these special for Valentine's Day. These have always been my daughter's favorite so I was going to mail her some to college for Valentine's Day and was pleasantly surprised to see that I could send her heart shaped ones and at a really fair price as well!,positive
Has a very salty odor and taste.,negative
This is the exact ingredients for making some delicious kettle corn.  Wish it [the kit] was easily found locally here.,positive
Delicious coffee! I am so happy that they offer a 10 ct. variety pack so I can figure out what flavor I like before purchasing a larger quantity! The bag is also cute.,positive
"Love love love!  Taste just like the tea that panera calls""Acai berry"".",positive
"This sweetener has a low glycemic index and should be a good aid in losing weight. I have lost forty pounds so far and avoiding sugar has been a prime reason. I also like the fact that this is not made from corn since corn has naturally occurring MSG, which I also try to avoid.",positive
I love all 3 flavors. Especially the caramel!!! I am diabetic and drank them at the beach this year.  So refreshing and delicious,positive
Packaged monstrous...but it's sugar.  It made my tea sweet.  It had one job and it did that job.  Way to go buddy.  Way to go!,positive
Love this coffee. Nice rich flavor and never bitter,positive
I drink this tea most mornings - flavorful.  This brand has lots of types but Darjeeling Organic is my favorite.,positive
"Flavor was very good and candy was fresh but I think the cost was high for the amount given. However, I would order again if I had the craving for them again.",positive
She loves all the variety of teas! Said the taste of peppermint was delicious! Great choice!,positive
"If I had to survive on a desert island with nothing but this coffee, I'd thrive.",positive
Stored.,positive
My husband and I love the Pecan Shop.  Quality is so important when you are paying a premium (however very competitive) price for organic products.  The walnuts are so perfect it is as if each were carefully and ever so gingerly removed from their shell....quite honestly I have no idea how they do it!!!Our favorite is the unsalted organic raw sprouted!  You will not be disappointed.,positive
I thought that I was ordering what is depicted in the photo on the sales page. What I received was is in the photo that I have shared. It is not Earl Grey....it is English Breakfast and the taste to be nice is different.,negative
Nasty taste spoiled,negative
Arrived quickly. A little cheaper than the stores. My husband drinks it every day to supplement his dietary needs. Good product.,positive
Too much juice-thought it was Tea,negative
All time favorite gift for the family at Easter so classy enough for everybody that came to visit the house to have some and more one of the more elegant ways to celebrate Easter gifts for adults especially,positive
"Never seen anything like it before, the wife noodles just fell apart. This happened prior to they’re being completely cooked so overcooking wasn’t an issue. Made a total mess of the recipe.",negative
"Some reviewers online have said ""mushy"" and that is not accurate. They are tender",positive
Excellent antipasto food to add to a charcuterie board or for unexpected guests and just a great little snack.,positive
"I like beefsteak tomatoes and while these are not exactly the beefsteak tomatoes I get at another store, they are very good.",positive
The aroma is good but it does not translate to taste.,negative
"I love this coconut milk powder! I use it for my Milk Bath Soaks, and my customers love them.",positive
We cook with this all the time.  Great smokey flavor.,positive
I have now tried THREE TIMES to order Cinnamon and Oats 88 Acres Bars and have received the WRING flavor each time!  3 times and I’m OUTTA HERE!!  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!  They got it right the first time and never again!  They are NOT RETURNABLE which exacerbated the frustration !,positive
"One of the very best hot pepper jellies I've ever had.  The only thing I don't like is the label on the jar that advises, ""do not refrigerate, product may crystalize"".  I do like my jams and jellies cold.  Other than that, it's delicious!  I just ordered another jar.",positive
"This product tastes great. Add it to hot unsweetened almond milk, it is a most delightful drink. Tastes just like the sugary hot chocolates.",positive
Grandkids live these,positive
Best flavor I've found so far! I drink ALOT of coffee (iced espresso to be exact) I use milk Carmel sauce and cinnamon syrup that's it so I like a bold but smooth cinnamon flavor. I've tried ALOT of different syrups and this one definitely has the best flavor (without having to use 3oz of syrup) doesn't add sweetness which is a major plus!!,positive
Try this with chicken and butter in a crock pot for 6 hours and then shred! Family favorite of ours!Also tastes great when you brine and then roast sweet potatoes and squash,positive
I love this meal. Goes great with tortilla chips.,positive
Gorgeous cake topper!!,positive
Guilty comfort food! Sooo good 😋,positive
Man salt at its best !!!,positive
Lots of compliments on a pilaf and cous cous salad. Great flavor.,positive
"The first instant I've tasted, that can truly replace fresh brewed coffee !",positive
"It's definitely more on the expensive side, but once you taste it you understand. I've been looking for something that has no pesticides, has been tested more than once, no mold and organic. I found this and I love it! It is super smooth you can taste the freshness right off the bat. I will definitely be buying again!",positive
"These bagels are modest in size, too salty and overpriced!",negative
"Arrived a melted smeared mess..totally unable to give ccx as gift. Threw them away. Horrible, careless packaging. Huge waste...",negative
"I have purchased this Sherpa Pink Himalayan Salt a couple of times now and it does not disappoint.I have noticed that the Himalayan Salt in general is ""saltier"" than regular salt, so less is usually used in anything I cook: hence why one bag can last a long time! The taste and consistency are great, and it is a healthier and less processed option which is the direction I am heading for my family.Thank you!",positive
Better than any mayonnaise I have ever had. Super creamy!!!!  Delicious!!!,positive
This doesn’t taste anything like a proper Russian Caravan blend. It’s more like some leaves found under a dirty old caravan at a campsite circa 1971. Possibly in Russia but that’s as close as it gets to being a legitimate expression of that delicious tea blend. Not recommended at all.,negative
Was totally disappointed no flavor just a buttery taste. Will never purchase again,negative
"The problem with the product I received was put is a cheap looking box, not like the description shows. The product doesn't fit the box as shown in description. One of the boxes had the shipping label plastered of it and the label won't come off without ripping the outside of the box. One of the corner edges of one of the boxes is badly damaged and ripped! Don't worry, forget the fricken refund this crap is going into trash. It's not even worth returning. I learned my lesson with this company. I will never buy anything from Swiss Colony again.",negative
"Tasty licorice, like when i was a kid,soft, with no preservativesBag gets a little sticky inside during multiple servings, but as a licoriceaholic, one or two servings is all i usually get…",positive
I'm very happy with this,positive
"I ate a whole bag, myself, for Halloween. Who says you can't go home again?It took a Long time to eat all this candy. When it arrived I thought I cornered the market of candy corn. Soft, chewy, Sweet. Mmmmmmmmm..4 pounds, Wow.",positive
"I have been using this for my Kombucha, and it works great. Way cheaper than any of the other teas I've used, as you get 5 packs of 100 per order. This will last me a long time! The quality is very good too.",positive
Devious & Different,positive
I couldn't taste the chocolate or the espresso.  The trash can got this treat.,negative
"I love this tea. It is good for my morning power drink. Such a great value and certainly better than I've ever purchased at this price and weight point. Beautiful green (not emerald, but vibrant). Wonderful.",positive
"This rub is great, this is a really good all purpose rub that has awesome flavor. I am planning on buying again soon.",positive
"just got tested for food allergies, came back positive for wheat :/this bread is so good! huge relief.",positive
"We all love River Street Sweets, so when I saw them available on Amazon, I ordered them as an additional gift for my son and his family.  We had ordered individually wrapped bear claws for their wedding table, which were so well-received.  The basket was lovely, packed to the brim with shredded paper.  Imagine my surprise when there were few edible products: two bear claws, three pralines and a couple of other things.  Given that the price was almost $90.00, as my son said, ""Mom, you got hosed.""Really?  Incredibly disappointing and does not reflect favorably on River Street Sweets at all.",negative
"So good, they're addicting",positive
"Great flavor and texture. My toddler is such a picky eater, and I’m so glad he likes these!",positive
I actually use this on my natural hair. I mix it with amino acid and molasses. Gives me great shin and helps to clump and for my curls. Brings out my curly texture more. My hair has grown a lot and retained length by adding this to my regimen.,positive
my hubby favorite snack,positive
"As an olive obsessed foodie, I saw these on Instagram and had to try them. They are incredibly delicious and addicting. Especially the lemon garlic flavor pack, the olives are crisp and the flavor is a perfect balance of garlic and lemon. I don’t feel guilty when I’m snacking on these and they’re so satisfying. These olives have converted my bf (who used to make fun of me for being obsessed with olives) into an olive lover who eats a pack of these almost everyday",positive
"Excellent coffee, smooth and rich in flavors",positive
"Just finished a 3-lb bag, will be purchasing a larger bag in the future. I cooked wheat berries and made flour. I used the flour to make a great sourdough starter.",positive
"This is perfect as a light breakfast to help curb an sweet tooth at the same, time.",positive
"As a vegetarian, it's sometimes hard to build complex flavors in soup.  Meat is very flavorful.  But these little cubes solve the problem for me.  The flavor is rich and authentic, and the intensity of flavor is just right - not salty, not to weak, not too strong.  I use these in barley soup, asian soup, ""meat"" loaf, ""meat"" balls, anything that needs a rich flavor.  They make a great and easy home-made ramen noodle bowl, as well.  These are better than any vegetable boullion I have found in any brand.  I wish they weren't so hard to find!One thing to note is that these do list MSG in the ingredients.  If you're sensitive to MSG, these are not for you.",positive
This is the only coffee I drink and I order it exclusively from Amazon.com.,positive
love it. not so powerful taste. light.,positive
I ordered because i couldn’t find any in store. Worth it for 100+ Small bags.,positive
I Love pickle juice,positive
I use this WITH a yeast base like Vegex or Marmite to get perfect gravy. Even better than using real beef.,positive
Love See’s Candy. Sent to my brother in a board and care home.,positive
THIS IS SOOOO PRETTY!!!  Its a great size!!! Wanted to update my review with a picture for future buyers!  Hoping everyone loves their topper as much as I do!,positive
"We originally received a box of Enstrom's Dark Chocolate Almond Toffee as a gift years ago. My wife and I thought it was the best we had ever had and based on that, began ordering it for gifts and for ourselves, usually for Christmas. We had not in the past few years, but that was not because of the product. When I realized we had not had the Enstrom's toffee in several years, we decided to order some this year. It is as good as it ever was. Enstrom also initially shipped the wrong item (their assorted chocolates) but they quickly corrected the mistake and shipped us the toffee originally ordered and though I offered to pay for it, they said I did not need to as the error was theirs. I gave the assorted chocolates to my colleagues at work and they universally praised them, some taking note of where to order them! Their products are on the expensive side, but well worth the price in our opinion.",positive
"Was looking for a good alternative because I am trying to quit smoking all together, but am not quite done with my hookah and these are AWESOME!!!!! and I can tell my lungs appreciate it and it gets going REALLY WELL!",positive
Delicious! Wish there were more in the pack,positive
My fave sports drink. I never drink the other bread and ordering this here is so easy.,positive
Great flavors a good variety true to the taste. Very happy with the purchaae.,positive
this product is compatible with the Nespresso Virtuo machine. Delicious,positive
"I wasn’t a believer of this coffee until my son made me some and I tried it. I’m a cafe con leche mom, until now. I switched. You can wean yourself off sugar by replacing sweetener with stevia. Now I can drink Bulletproof daily with grass fed butter and or bulletproof oil. No more highs and lows or shivers or shakes from other coffees. I’ll never go back to the other cheap processes brands. Thank you Bullet Proof! What do you have to lose...try it!!!",positive
WOuld recomend,positive
I thInk the price is insane on this product! 4 pouches in one box for over $8! Boxed has a 12 count box for $8. You get 6 Apple strawberry and 6 Apple banana. Just seems to be way to high here!,negative
They were way too soft,negative
I really enjoyed the combination of chocolate and orange.,positive
"Dear Amazon Shoppers:  I’m eating the spaghetti package with black beans and taco sauce as I write this review and want you to know it is delicious!  As I said in the title:  I’m happy, happy HAPPY to have found a noodle product I can eat and stay true to my low carb way of life.  Thank you, Natural Heaven; thank you with all my heart.  ❤️🌹😋",positive
Great would buy here regularly,positive
"I need to order more! I bought a box, gave most of it away, now I am missing it!",positive
I love this product!  Great flavor!  The last time I ordered it they ran out when I tried to reorder.  Waited patiently for it to be back in stock.  Ordered extra this time!  I do not drink pop/soda so this is a fantastic alternative to water.  It helps me keep my blood sugar in check when I want something sweet.,positive
"I wish I could write a good review but this just...doesn’t taste good. I have used several store bought cold brew coffees and this wasn’t nearly as good as Starbuck’s, Stok or Chameleon. I tried it black and with creamer, the coffee is strong but the taste is bad.",negative
"I thought this was a great way to make effortless food with no cleanup. It's very good alone or with some toast to soak up the leftover sauce, but you can just drink it once you reach the bottom. The cup does not get hot after you microwave and the lid does a great job keeping the stuff inside, but I always use a paper plate under them just to keep things tidy. This tastes very similar to the  ravioli, I like them both !",positive
Love this stuff and the Daily one too...great price and nothing much more to say but well worth the money!,positive
Concentrated taste smell and texture. Very nice,positive
These flavors are like none I've ever found in a jar. Absolutely fresh and tangy and just special. I'm a customer for life!🥰,positive
After seeing the reviews I was worried about freshness. So when I received it I was very pleased how fresh it was.,positive
"It’s delicious and hot. I was going to take a star off because it says “more than 1 drop is suicide,” and, unfortunately, I lived🙄 But 2020 has been full of disappointments and misery so I gave it 5 stars and just chucked it up to the year😂",positive
I really wanted to like these little canned coffees. I am sucker for packaging. I am sucker for trying new things from other countries. I have consumed some very distasteful canned coffees in my time but these are by far the absolute worst I have tasted. I cannot even make it through a second can. Spouse says they have an alcohol aftertaste. I tried my best to like this coffee; it tastes really bad.,negative
we love this stuff overnight in the crockpot. it's becoming a family favorite,positive
The texture of these Beef/Apple/Bacon bars is off. They were extremely dry and grainy. The taste was just awful - like roadkill. I spat it out and had to wash the taste out of my mouth as I was about to throw up. Another review stated that dog food was probably better. I'd say that's a good comparison. And I'd have to agree. It's like really really bad dog food.,negative
Half (12 )were past date on package.,negative
This is such a great product. Love this organic Ghee.,positive
For some time I have been buying coffee pods from Amazon and I have never been disappointed.,positive
Oh my gosh! So delicious! Generous amount of cherries!,positive
"The fact that they are such a dark chocolate crumbly cookie makes them such a mess to eat. The Vanilla Chai and the Snickerdoodles I could eat forever but these are just too much of a hassle and the flavor is alright, not great. So sorry but just would not get them again. I WILL continue to get all the other flavors.. Thank you for making these products; we are addicted..",negative
"I used to love this brand but the last few times the cookies, brownies have been very dry.",negative
After storing the rice in two  mason jars for several days we observed the emergence of winged insects' living in the rice...I can only assume the legs were laid before packaging and simply went along for the ride.,negative
Chocolate chip cookie dough is amazing. Love these plant protein bars. Best flavor - others aren't quite as good.,positive
Was opened when I got it...dried out,negative
This product doesn’t taste like chocolate. Too much licorice overpowers the taste.  If you’re looking for a classic hot chocolate this isn’t the one for you.,negative
There is a good variety of teas. We use it for our office and there is something for everyone.,positive
Very good soup!! Lots of flavor and the price is reasonable.,positive
I don't need to buy Rotisserie chicken anymore. I make my own.,positive
The beans were flavorful.,positive
Get em.  They are yummy!,positive
I just got my order today and they taste DISGUSTING. Almost like they're old. They look old too. Will never buy this brand again. 🤢,negative
Excellent syrups.,positive
"I don't know where my local grocery store buys their garlic, but it's awful. These are big, fresh and tasty. Thank you for offering them.",positive
"YUCK!  I enjoy many of the flavored cappuccinos, but this one is vile!  Try other flavors.",negative
"The first time I ordered these crackers (for an elderly woman) they were great. This order is horrible, the crackers are stale and hard as a rock. One box is open with the outer plastic still around it.",negative
Best vegan broth I’ve had. Seasoned like a drinking broth and perfect base broth to any soup with the umami from the mushrooms!,positive
This bih goooood,positive
"I had such hopes for this jam after watching the video & really wanted to love it… but it’s nothing like what’s pictured in the film. Mine is 3 months before the expectation date but it’s brownish not red like the fruit! It’s mushy, no whole berries, not at all sweet, with big horrible seeds to chew!!!",negative
Great taste for the whole family,positive
I have been searching for matzah farfel at my market for months. I prefer it to salty crackers in my soup. Found this product on Amazon and was thrilled. Fresh farfel. No sodium. Good packaging so it will retain its freshness.,positive
Airtight container keeps powder fresh. I mix to hot water for drink and add to frozen fruit smoothie and protein shake for added flavor.,positive
"Great for baking dishes, French toast and many awesome recipes!",positive
A little bitter tasting.,negative
Was infested with bugs!!!,negative
"These are pretty good. It is a good variety of meat some are beef, some pork and some labeled as snack sticks. I travel for work a lot and wanted to have these when I need some protien and no time to stop for a meal. I will buy again.",positive
Wow these are disgusting not good at all and they're grainey and don't integrate and settle really weird not a good product at all and weirdly expensive for what they are.,negative
I use this product because it's healthier than sugar and 0 calaries. There is no aftertaste.,positive
only tried one other brand one time and found these on amazon but read the bad reviews so only bought one not sure what all the fuss was about they are good even the juice is good and will buy more next time.  They seem to make my hair appear straighter which is a great side effect. : ),positive
Great flavor best value for the money,positive
Very large shells.  Great Value!,positive
"I knew this wasn't 100% coffee from some of the other reviews, but I thought I'd give it a try for the price. Very underwhelming. Upon grinding, it just smelled like old stale coffee, and it didn't get much better after brewing. There is no indication for when the beans were roasted so I have no idea how long it's been since they've been roasted. There is an expiration date on the packaging, but that's about it. This may be ok for someone who isn't too picky about coffee, but given the fact that I'm grinding my own beans, I would expect a difference in the flavor profile from that of preground coffee. Oh well.",negative
"The coffee tastes fresh because they package it in a keep fresh bag. The pods are just the top and filter, so you aren't throwing away plastic cups. Brilliant!  And It is delicious coffee !",positive
"This OJ is pricey, I know, but once you have it, no other orange juice will compare. When I buy it, it's gone after the first day because everyone in our family loves it. I wish they had a frequent buyer card on their fresh juices. I'd certainly buy more. If you are having guests for breakfast, you have to serve this. You won't regret it.",positive
Nice pack.,positive
They were great! They were a little stuck but I didn’t buy them and spect them to be perfect they are candy and they are great!,positive
"Absolutely horrible smelling! I've stuffed sausage for many years and this is by far the worse smelling casings that I have ever dealt with.  No amount of rinsing (inside and out) could help these things, straight to the trash can and then out to the curb to get the god awful smell out of the house. Listen to the negative reviews on this one, I should have.",negative
"These peanut butters are just downright great.  The White Chocolate Wonderful is one of the best things that I've ever eaten.  If you're a fan of peanut butter or just joy in general, you should go ahead and buy this pack.",positive
"I ordered this item and got the first set. It was as advertised and perfect. I needed additional and wanted the same ones, so I ordered again.  The second order came and it was not the same.  The sonic character images were different and way bigger on the toothpicks.  The main happy birthday cake topper was smaller than the first order.  Also the print quality was very light.  Some of the images on the toothpicks were blurry.  The first order came very orgamized and the second set did not.  All the cupcake toppers were thrown in the package in a very disprganized way.  It is also as they came from 2 different sellers. I attached images for reference.",negative
Love it!! Makes drinking water easier,positive
Mommy. So delish!,positive
"If you love almond cookies , you have to try these.",positive
I only received a 3 pack not the 5 pack I paid for,negative
Too expensive and single sided.,negative
This stuff is great.  Adds flavor to your water without adding anything you don't want!,positive
Wonderfully dark roast! Great for the coffee lover in your life.,positive
"First foremost I get that it's all natural ...but for all the reviewers who said this is good idk if your getting paid or how you come to this conclusion. I took one bite almost died instantly not only for taste but it sucked every bit of moisture out of my mouth and tongue.I'll stick to ""unhealthy"" kind if taste difference is that extreme.",negative
I have never had Spanish roast coffee. This was really really good stuff! I recommend trying if you like different coffee flavors.,positive
"Really sour, and tasty candy. The reason I'm reviewing this negatively is the fact that they completely destroy your mouth and teeth. I don't mind the damage done to my mouth, because that's just what happens with sour candy. But what they did to my teeth was completely unbearable. After just one, you feel a gritty feeling all over your teeth and you can feel it doing damage. When I first received them, I ate two or three and I was in pain because I soon felt them corroding my teeth. Doing permanent damage. These candies are good but are NOT worth the painful corrosive damage they inflict upon your teeth. If you have healthy teeth, stay away from these.",negative
Bubly + Pineapple = ❤️,positive
"I'm not gluten free, but this pancake mix is so good that I'd never go back to regular flour pancake mix again. I do use a little yogurt in the mix to make the pancakes fluffy and this works like a charm. Everyone loves these pancakes.",positive
These mango-peach flavored tea bags are delicious! the price is amazing too!,positive
Excellent product ... fresh and very good tasting.  Will definitely order again.,positive
Can barely taste the hazelnut. Poor flavorI will pass on future purchases. I will find another brand. Disappointing I guess you get what you pay for.,negative
"I'm a sucker for balsamic vinegar and is used to the oaky and somewhat 'alcoholly' flavors that comes along with it, but this was just plain and sweet, also a bit too thick in consistency. Price was 50% off so I thought what the hell.",negative
Great bone broth. I use it for my little dogs.,positive
I don’t consider this food. And normally I would eat just about anything. DisgustingI’ll go back to the box.,negative
I love this tea I have it almost every morning,positive
All good!  Thanks Twinnings!,positive
their good but are really small. This may not last long.,positive
"How often do you hear QUICK, ONE THE GO and HEALTHY in the same sentence? These are perfect for work lunches or a meal on the go. Healthy and very tasty. I was surprised with how filling these are!",positive
"My husband enjoys a glass every morning. He says best tomato juice he's tasted. We use this one because of the low sodium, he has a heart condition.",positive
Very disappointed in the flavor.  Water down taste and nothing like the velvety texture of Nespresso. Waste of money since they're not eligible for return.,negative
Love this stuff! Add it to my black and green tea for some extra flavor :),positive
Received them all broken up. Basically crumbs so I couldn’t use them for cheese. Very disappointed.,negative
"These wraps are the perfect alternative to seaweed paper. I only use soy paper to make my sushi, and my family is addicted. They also work well when I use them for my tempura rolls.",positive
"Very good, I liked this one better than the plain jerky of the same brand.I read in some of the negative comments about it being powdery or tasting old which worried me since I ordered 2 lbs of it in total.  The texture was perfect.  It was very dry, as jerky should be (I hate the moist stuff you find in t he stores) and it tears apart just like the stuff I make at home.  It did have some fat on it, but just the right amount to add more flavor.  There was a surprising amount in the bag, so paying so much for it was easier to swallow, but took longer to swallow than I had planned since there was so much of it!",positive
My nephew is obsessed with these. He loved the surprise.,positive
"I use this flour as a starch replacer, and its awesome!",positive
I am South African so I grew up drinking Rooibos.,positive
This is great... I love it !,positive
"I was unable to find buckwheat flour anywhere around my area.  After some research, I decided to get the Haldeman Mills Light Buckwheat Flour.  The size was more manageable than most other larger bags.I was using this flour to make a tart.The flour arrived, and was extremely well packed inside a sealed plastic bag, with a personal note inside.I felt somewhat accomplished knowing this company is family owned and run...Nice!Overall, this product is wonderful.  The size is just right, the price is very competitive, and their attention to detail in the buying experience and their care in handling their product is exceptional.Would certainly buy again from them.Highly Recommended!",positive

"I ordered a case of Life WTR with the goal to drink healthier water. I liked that it was PH balanced and the ""idea"" that it contained electrolytes.  Both sounded like they were beneficial to a healthier body.After drinking about 6 bottles over a span of 3 days, I started feeling nervous and anxious.After researching the side effects of taking in too many electrolytes, I realized that the Life WTR could very well be the cause of this. I won't be drinking anymore Life WTR. I would like very much to get a refund.",negative

These are my favorite candy and no store can beat this price.,positive
I ordered 2 packages and only received 1.,negative
these have a good tasting quality,positive
"I bought this selection thinking I could rate the different flavors and buy them in the future.  After tasting all 24, I only found 2! that I would consider drinking, let alone buying again.  A couple of cups I made want down the drain after I had a taste. Save your money and buy another brand.",negative
"Lovely,  fresh ground and put in coffee.",positive
I love the extra bit of raspberry flavor of the whipped honey. It slides off the spoon into my green tea and pomegranate making it something I look forward to every day.,positive
Very delicious and for the price you cant beat it. Ill be ordering this from now on instead of the expensive nestle brand.,positive
Love this stuff.  Tastes great and goes well with practically everything.  Just a little pricey.,positive
"A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novel, 1984. I was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books I've read recently. So when I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation measured up. Unfortunately, the movie didn't even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that Orwell so masterfully did in his book. The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book, because he makes no attempt to demonstrate WHY the characters act and feel the way they do. John Hurt, the main actor, is droll the entire way through, and hardly does any acting until the end. We never really find out what he does for a living, or why his love affair is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the main character desires rebellion. This book cannot be done justice in movie form without proper narration and explanation of the political system oppressing the characters, and the fact that those are missing is the greatest shortcoming of this film. Besides that, John Hurt was a terrible casting choice, looking about 15 years older than the 39 year old Winston he was supposed to be portraying. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. It's just too bad they were put in such a horribly adapted film with the wrong lead actor. -Brian O.",negative
For a lot more flavor on your favorite meats .,positive
This smells like (eggs) sulfur so they are great for vegan “eggs”,positive
Love this product. Next time I will buy two cases as it runs out of stock fastDelivery always excellent,positive
I wish it was less expensive but I LOVED HAVING A TASTE OF MY CHILDHOOD BACK!! My family loved them too.,positive
I've been searching for this flavor for so long. I use it in my favorite brownie recipe for a darker look and deeper dark chocolate flavor. Absolutely love it.,positive
This is my go to coffee. I love the flavor!! The price is reasonable for how many K cups you get. Definitely recommend it!!,negative
These cookies are delicious.  We first found them in New Zealand and in Austrailia while traveling several years ago.  The problem with them is once you open the package you have to eat them all.  So good.....,positive
My bars arrived fine soft like they just baked them.  I would purchase again.  I will try other flavors.,positive
DeliciousKids love for lunchHearty and filling,positive
"Okay this stuff is incredible. I barely need to use any creamers or sweeteners, and I generally like my coffee light and sweet. I can put it right in my reusable k-cup pod and it brews great. EXCEPT: the pumpkin spice flavor (which is absolutely amazing and I want to buy 10 more bags), is so fine that it clogs my cup. Not sure if it's that it's so fine, or the other ingredients, but it clogs it and backspills in my machine. So I'm just brewing it now using tea filters just like I do for my loose leaf tea, and it works great!",positive
"Purchased this 3 years ago and I am still using the same one in my Keurig coffee maker, at least 2 times a day. Great way to enjoy your favorite coffee while using a lot less of it. I find that the more expensive brands grind their coffee much finer and therefore I can use half the amount. If I completely fill this reusable K-cup with a fine grind, it is difficult for the water to get thru the filter and too strong anyway. This product is environmentally friendly and extremely economical. I wish someone made as good of a single cup coffee maker as Solo has made this filter.",positive
Love this tea sampler. Every flavor is a great taste experience. Will definitely buy again in future.,positive
Excellent tea.  Smooth flavor even after long steeping.,positive

I order these a lot! They taste like watermelon jolly ranchers. These and the green apple are my favorite candy.,positive
I was a little hesitant to order fondant because of the taste. This brand taste very good. I was shocked that it tasted that way. It's very easy to use & work with. My kids love it.,positive

Great Jordan almonds. Great value. I read the comments about how hard and they ate meant to be sucked for a a while. If you try to chew straight away you'll find them hard but if eaten as they should you'll enjoy them. Will order when I want more but 5 lbs goes a long way.,positive

"This is salt that you should to the best of meals. Recommended by doctors, this sea salt has the right nutrition for anyone.

You can add for just about anything and you will be glad that you did.",positive

De-licious!!! My new favorite tea.,positive
"I was so excited to try the coffee, however when we received the package you could hear  a lot of beans rolling around the box, upon opening the box we discovered that the bottom of the bag was busted open and the coffee beans were everywhere. The coffee smells great, but since I don’t try food or drinks that have been previously opened before they are purchased we will not be trying the coffee.The seller apparently also does not offer refunds or exchanges, so we will not be reordering and have wasted money. Highly unfortunate.",negative

Honestly a glass of milk is spicer than this variant of Chex Mix.... what a let down,negative
After looking everywhere for this tea I found it here. I can now make the best medicine balls just like Starbucks. Just add honey and lemon!,positive
The jam taste like lemons; you cannot taste the blackberries.,negative
Love these ginger candies! I take these anytime I feel nauseous and it works within minutes. Thank you for a great product!,positive
great tea...usually place a tea bag in a bottle of spring water for a few hours which allows more of the chemical benefits then brewing hot i've learned,positive
Packs that mints come in are very pretty but mints really taste bad. Only thing they are good for is table decoration that hopefully no one tries to eat.,negative

Get Well gift for someone who had surgery.  Patient was surprised and thrilled with package contents!,positive
"I take medication that blocks me up terribly. They work quick and extremely well. They're not overkill either. Most probiotics don't taste good but these taste delicious and they work better than anything else I've found. They're both fiber and probiotics so i don't have to buy 2 different products anymore. Honestly my only problem with them is they're constantly sold out at the grocery store. I had to travel to 3 different stores and had a 4th hang up on me while looking for this product. I finally just ordered them here. They are cheaper at the grocery store though, so maybe lower the price a little bit.",positive
"I love going out and trying Bloody Mary's at different places.  However, sometimes you just want to stay in and make one at home.  This is BY FAR my favorite mix that I have tried and so easy.  Just vodka, clamato, and a cap full of this and you have an amazing bloody.  I gave them out for Christmas gifts for all my bloody peeps.",positive
The blend is aromatic and service was fast and easy. I used this as an adult beverage at my dinner party and my guests have me rave reviews on my spice blend abilities. I would highly reccomend to anyone looking to impress,positive
These taste just like Oreos! A tad crumbly but same great taste.,positive

I wrote a review for this product not long ago which was complimentary but did mention that the cookies did not hold up well during shipping.  I love them broken or not but this order was beautifully packed and as near as I can tell (2 cookies in...) every cookie survived intact.  Good job Amay!,positive
"Our 3.5 year old granddaughter loves these pouches.  Had tried them from a local market and she really liked them.  So glad I was able to find the variety pack on Amazon.  She loves all 3 flavors, but cinnamon is her favorite.",positive
Yep... Thats good noodle soup!,positive
"Bought this just to sample different types of hot sauces and did a hot sauce challenge with friends.  These aren't your standard hot sauces.  All of them had flavor as well as heat and were very different from each other.  Really loved the variety of flavors and will order some of them individually because they were so good (and I usually don't eat hot sauce)!  There were varying degrees of heat but none of them were insanely hot, just very tasty and different.  Well worth the price.",positive
These were a perfect Super Bowl sandwich - loved them!,positive
I love this tea. I love the taste of jasmine green tea. Full of flavor and the leaves are fresh and long lasting to make even 3 pots of tea. The value of what you get in this beautiful tin container is enough to last 6mths or more depending on how often you drink the tea its filled the rim of the container. Not one thing wrong with this tea. The scent of jasmine is exhilarating.,positive
"Love Caffe D’Vita! French Vanilla is my favorite. I can’t have caffeine so this way I can have a yummy, decadent drink I can’t anywhere else. Well packed for delivery. Quick transaction. Thanks!",positive
"It just didn’t taste good.. at all.  I would never buy this again.  I tried it, my wife tried it... we even let the dog try it (and she’s eaten deer poop....the dog, not my wife) then we threw it in the trash.",negative
Really tasty and came in good condition as always. These are my go to mid afternoon snack.,positive
One of my favorite breakfasts.,positive
"Using these as a sort of preworkout. I workout pretty early in the mornings so these are easy to grab and drink on the way to the gym. Great flavors, awesome ingredients! Wild Orange is my favorite, mixed berry is second, Original flavor is third!",positive
This flavored drop was very tasty.  It made my coffee and water taste better and more healthy than sugar...,positive
I like that is has less carbs but tastes great.,positive
It would have been nice to know this wasn’t a secular product. I prefer my snacks non religious. There was no mention in the description about the Psalms reference that was put on the bag. I won’t purchase these or anything from this company again.,negative
This coffee was stronger than breakfast blend I am use to drinking.  After drinking for 1 week the coffee began causing problems with my acid reflux even though it came up in search for low acid k cups on Amazon.  Not happy with purchase and I could not return.  Very disappointed and a waste of my money.  Do not purchase if you are looking for low acid k cups.,negative
I had been buying my vanilla beans from the grocery store. It consisted of ONE bean in a glass jar. The bean was tough as shoe leather. I ordered these beans from Amazon and I was thrilled when I cut into them. They were moist and fresh. When I scraped them with a knife they yielded a huge amount of vanilla paste. I am using them to make vanilla for baking. This is a win-win deal. I save money on the beans and I get a great vanilla!,positive

"Yes, the container is weird and different. I don't think mine came with a pour spout, but I don't care. I have an empty soy sauce bottle with the slow-pouring spout that I filled with the sesame oil. I can refill it and easily store in my cabinet. I'm so happy to have plenty of sesame oil for such a great value. Thanks to all who have commented so I could plan to get my bottle ready!",positive
This is terrible. It taste like powdered salt with yellow food coloring. I really don't see what all the rave reviews are about. I am returning.,negative
I like to add it to my protein shakes.  It gives you the peanut butter taste without all the fat and calories.,positive
This is great on popcorn but haven't tried it on a very thing listed but I imagine it would task good on corn on the cob. Nice heat not overwhelming. It's something a little different.,positive
"I had this in California recently and that version had pieces of coconut in it; and I liked this brand, which is why I ordered a case when I got home to New York...didn't get the coconut pieces with this order version and that was a disappointment...it is better, as they recommend, chilled but the overall mouth feel and flavor and aftertaste I have to say are all very repellant. I guess I'm not a coconut water person; I've tried several brands. I've tried mixing with seltzer, lemon juice, mango nectar...none work for me!",negative
"I love peanut butter, I love cookies, I even love most of the nutrition food out there these days, so I figured the peanut butter Quest cookies would be great. I was wrong. They taste horrible, and leave a nasty chemical-lemony after flavor in your mouth you can't get rid of for a couple hours. I gave them to friends to see if anyone wanted them, and everyone told me they could not finish one cookie and threw it away.",negative
super cute!!!!,positive
The flavor was really good but I would not buy it again due to the price. I thought there was more than (1) box in the package!,positive
"I mix these with vegetable dishes, sauted mushrooms, soups, etc.They absorb flavors.I usually rinse and cut them shorter before adding to my dish.",positive
"This bread is amazing.  It tastes even better when toasted.  I like to pair it with burratta, basil and tomatoes drizzled with olive oil and balsamic.",positive
Awesome. Simple rub. Nothing to crazy and taste amazing. Definitely compliments the meat instead of being over powering.,positive
I use these for everything from soup to gravy and a lot more.,positive
This is some of the best dark chocolate I’ve ever had. The box arrived well padded and with an ice pack to make sure that the chocolate didn’t melt. The flavors and textures are amazing and I will definitely be ordering again.,positive
"Used the product to make vanilla extract. A little expensive for the beans, but they were Madagascar beans.",positive
"I’ve had this jerky before so I know it’s usually pretty good. That being said, they sent me some jerky at the end of its life so the quality has drastically dropped. It’s usually pretty tender and there’s more taste than just spiciness, but with so little time until expiration, now it’s tough as leather and the spice is all I taste. Maybe they have a lot in stock and not that many sales? I don’t know. But even if it isn’t expired. Not sending out fresh goods will only hurt it. I wouldn’t buy this again and that sucks because when it’s fresh it’s delicious. I just don’t want to waste money when I might get this again.",negative
delicious and perfectly sour,positive
tastes good and works fast! Has helped with stomach issues,positive
"A friend gave me a sample bottle of this stuff from his visit to Belize. I liked it so much I bought more off Amazon!It of course has a strong Verde flavor from the nopales with some habanero heat. However, the heat doesnt linger for very long which is nice. This is a good daily hot sauce that adds flavor without being uncomfortably painful.I also like the Marie Sharps ""Belizean Heat"" habanero sauce that is red. That one is deffinitely hotter but somehow they managed to create a recipe that hits hard at first and quickly dissipates...A similar effect as Wasabe but with strong habanero flavor instead. It is also one of my new favorite sauces.",positive
Like them and buy on sale,positive
This is only $7.99 on their website.,positive
This was supposed to be a 3 pack but only one arrived. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,negative
"A: I really wasn't sure what to expect. So many of the powders you got have a creaminess. This is cleaner and...crispier! I mix it up in a mason jar, I can shake it that way, with cold filtered refrigerator water. It goes down smooth, and cleans up easy. One of the reviews mentions an insipid taste, another references artificiality, I just don't get any of that. To each his/her own :) I got mine at Costco, pretty affordable there.",positive
Great Price & Tastes great!,positive
Best Licorice! Will buy this for sure again!,positive
These ginger mints are especially good for a cough and tickle in the throat.  A great cough drop.  Ordering more now for the winter,positive
"Is this even real sea moss?????I washed, soaked, and blended per the instructions.But the finished product was much different than what I’m used to. Almost like the sea moss wasn’t real Seamoss.When I put it in the blender, I heard weird noises like I was blending plastic. That’s weird.Needless to say, I will NOT being using this brand again. It’s a shame they won’t let me return it.",negative
"I loved this matcha! It’s the best out of all the ones I’ve tried, and I’ve tried many. Buying culinary grade was the way to go for my matcha lattes and baked breakfasts. Was skeptical because I’m way too picky about my matcha, but I will most definitely be buying this one again!! Won’t be able to order from anyone else, now. You’ve just earned a happy, life-long customer!",positive
Love this gum! Always leaves my breath fresh,positive

Tastes like cough syrup... Wouldn't order again,negative
I should have believed the other reviews.  No flavor.  It’s basically oil.  Nothing like the one we used to get at Costco.  Very disappointing. Don’t waste your money.,negative
"Better than when I try to make gluten, dairy and egg free pancakes from scratch. I use a flax egg as substitute. My 4 year old and I liked them plain, with honey and with peanut butter. Will continue to buy.",positive
Good taste. I believe in label and quality.,positive
"These are very tasty, especially is you’re missing the granola bar in your life. You do have to LOVE coconut though. If you’re not a lover of coconut, this is not the bar for you. They are a bit pricey, but worth it for a quick snack when your on the go, not an everyday meal replacement. Will def be buying again.",positive
These are the first vanilla beans I have ordered that have been fresh.,positive
These are awful. The first time I bought them they were pretty good. But the last time they were tough and grisly. Never buying again.,negative
"I was looking for a cinnamon apple tea after (believe it or not) enjoying some of the same flavor Theraflu. The scent and the initial cinnamon apple flavor are great, but there is a really bad, bitter aftertaste. I really wanted to power through it (tried 3 cups), but I wound  up just pouring out the last one.",negative
Great tea. Mild flavor and good body. Perfect,positive
"We love maxwell house coffee, when we find a good price we like to stock up.",positive
I like to bake & use a lot of vanilla. A small bottle from the grocery store is expensive. Thus is an economical way to purchase it,positive
5 Stars is for hope.  These are in my survival kit and I hope they're easy and we enjoy them.,positive
"My local grocery store used to sell this popover mix; it comes and goes and unfortunately it's been gone a while.  I've tried plenty of home made popover recipes and most of the time they came out flat, no matter which little tricks I tried.  This mix is easy to make- and they bake perfect every time!  The hardest part is letting the batter sit for 30 minutes before you bake them.  I'm so happy I found them here on Amazon so now I can get them whenever I want!",positive
Got the wrong type. Meant to get the plain ones in olive oil ordered with lemon and its gross. No lemon flavor but the flavor it dose have is gross and the quality dose not seem as good as the plain.,negative
"They were not what I was expecting, broken and very small. The price was too high for something not in great condition.  I would not recommend these, unless you live close to the warehouse they are from. Maybe that way, they will be in one piece.",negative
Made some excellent soup with this!May want to order extra because it is a SMALL PACKAGE.,positive
"love the taste, you just need a little for smoothies or to bake, it lasts a long time.",positive
The best answer for gluten-free pancakes!,positive
sorry to say these are gross. My family agrees. The consistency is very rubbery. We didn't attempt the cheddar flavor as it just sounds so unappealing. The watermelon one did taste like watermelon but had a chemical after taste. The peach was lightly flavored but also chemical flavor. These didn't sit right in 2 out 4 peoples stomachs either. I can't recommend these.  Everyone compared it to tasting like glue.,negative
"It’s a terrific product, whether you add it to Greek yogurt (my wife) or eat it plain (me).",positive
The product had no smell  Looks like the cinnamon sticks were old. I will not buy these again,negative
"Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.",positive
I thought it would come as an advent calendar w/ a few bags in each pocket - but it didn’t but the quality of the tea was still a hit - but now I know. David’s Tea offers one and if you don’t grab one early it sells out! I wish you’ll do one next year!,positive
I love this tea!!! These are my favorite teas. The only tea I love all of the flavors. I only like loose leaf tea and this is the best. Will be a returning customer for years to come. Thank you.,positive

"All these reviewers are spot on. I've seen many bad films over the years, believe me, and this beats the lot!This is not just a ""so bad it's good"" exploiter waste of time, but a genuine, hilarious, movie atrocity.CHECK OUT the white furry monster type thing!WET YOURSELF LAUGHING at Thom Christopher's ""spell-weaving"" acting!GAPE IN SHEER A**E-CLENCHING DISBELIEF! at the threadbare sets!This is one of those ""European co-productions"". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear, some of the people taking part in 'Wizards of the Lost Kingdom' aren't actually aware they are appearing in a film!FACT! I originally watched this movie on HTV Wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful. It is. Worse even than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more laughable than all of John Derek's films, this is, truly, the Citizen Kane of Trash.",negative

I buy the 5 pack and give away one bag as a rule. They normally start buying it too! My little contribution to the economy of the beautiful country of Costa Rico! While in Costa Rico years ago, i went on a tour of the coffee farm. It was very clean and organized.

"I've tried other stevia products and have ben very disappointed. Either they had unwanted additives or the taste was very off-putting. This was the product I'd been searching for! I don't have a strong sweet tooth, but I do drink a lot of limonada (lime, not lemon) and it always tasted funny with other products--and not in a good way. After using the pure stevia from Now, I can finally enjoy my drink . I would definitely recommend this product and will be ordering it again.Update:  I have had this product for 6 months and I'm still on the first container (I ordered 2). I don't have a major sweet tooth, but I like my limonada and cappuccinos to be sweeeeeet. I'm still so in love with this product. I've used it in place of sugar for cole slaw and hubby never knew. You have to first taste it to work out your own personal level of sweetness, so I truly recommend that you do a dab, first, with your finger. It really is that sweet.I understand that others may avoid this product because it's made in China (although I don't know, never bothered to check), but not me. I don't care if it's make under yak poop in Timbuktu as long as it does the job...and it does. FWIW, I actually live in Mexico and have planted my own stevia plants in the garden, but I'll probably always have a jug of Now in the cupboard.",positive
Best fudge ever!!! Love this stuff,positive
I was looking forward to trying / eating your raw nuts -- but the sipper reports that the bag BROKE -- so delivery was NOT made...This would suggest that you should USE MORE DURABLE PACKAGING...,negative

"I will put a gun in my mouth before eating another one of these. Even if they were free. They suck. The texture is stale. They immediately disintegrate upon the first bite, spilling any toppings everywhere. The hot dog is softer than the bun.These are an abomination.The flavor has a metallic undertone that leaves me feeling ill afterward.I feel robbed.Violated to the core of my being.Nauseated just thinking of my spoiled wiener experience.",negative
"Great selection, no two the same, some very delicious and unusual flavors.",positive
"I bought this for my husband. regular and dark roast were not helping him. This coffee wakes him up and helps him focus til at least 3pm. Which is great compared to other coffees he has tried. He drinks it with just a little soy vanilla milk, no sugar needed. He says it taste great.",positive

"This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of ""This Stuff"" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less. After only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this ""SLOP""!",negative
I went to my local health food store and found them at a much higher price. These are good and I like that I can support a Washington farm.,positive

Product did not actually come with coconut aminos.  Very disappointed.  Will not buy again.,negative
THIS PACKAGE ARRIVED DAMAGED TWO OF THE BOTTLES WERE BROKEN AND SATURATED THE REST OF THE CONTENTS IN THE BOX.I WAS VERY UPSET.,negative
"These were so bad for me. I opened them up, pulled one out and it fell apart into pieces. Tried eating it and the taste was just so horrible, chemically tasting. Looks like I'm not the only one to have this experience. Unfortunately, I hate throwing away food (even candy) but I'm going to have to with this stuff.",negative
Trying to reduce calorie intake and Popcorn is the one food that helps and allows me to snack.  Adding a little additional flavor but no additional calories keeps me going.,positive
Very fresh and got here fast.,positive
"From the seaweed snacks I know, this is my favorite  so far. Personally I slightly prefer the almond over the pumpkin one, but the kids like both. I also like that there seem to be no preservatives added as some other brands do. Worth the price.",positive
Dad loves his coffee in morning. Great quality.,positive
Girlfriend loves em,positive
I love pretty much all of Harney and Son's teas but the Earl Grey is one of my absolute favorites! It has a really good flavor and it is pretty forgiving for amateur tea-makers (i.e. even when I sometimes forget it for many minutes longer than the recommended seeping time it doesn't get bitter).P.S. My favorite way to drink it is with a smidge of honey and a dash of milk! Yum!P.P.S Or drink it straight and hot and channel your inner Captain Picard.,positive
"The most delicious, delicately flavored  coconut butter I’ve ever come across. It has a bright, pure coconut flavor with almost floral undertones.",positive
Flavor is excellent!! Price a bit steep but worth it!!,positive
No one gives me as much value as Smuckers. God I wish I could buy this local but no one carries it. Thank god for Amazon.,positive
Very disappointed. The coarse salt has some dark brown granules that are like sand. So unpleasant on my teeth. :( getting a refund hopefully,negative

These are HUGE dense heavy yummy COOKIES num num num.I ate two of these on different days before I read that the serving size from the bag says two.Nevertheless if you eat a whole cookie 🍪 you will be full.,positive
This is exactly what I have been looking for unsuccessfully for many years.  I finally found a health drink that is not loaded with sugar or artificial sweetners and tastes great.  It is also the only drink I know of that contains L-Gluthione which is a powerful antioxidant that has many benefits.  I plan on making these drinks a part of my daily routine.,positive
"Fantastic and fresh candied ginger!  I've been buying my ginger locally, but I found it to be very inconsistent in texture and flavor, so I thought I'd give online a shot (especially since it's also cheaper).  Well, I ordered the 5lb bag from Bayside Candies and WOW!  Medium thick slices with a great peppery flavor.  I like my ginger with spice - but not so spicey that you run for water after a bit - and not so mild that it tastes like pure sugar - this was the perfect compromise.  After I finish off this 5lb (which is about a month for me), I will definitely be back for more.",positive
Had to order a similar item from another vendor here. This product appeared to have cake icing on it. It was also extremely flimsy. Cannot recommend. Re-ordered from NANASUKO. Their topper and tiara were perfect.,negative
"One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and I decided it was pretty lame. That was right after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse. I was pretty mystified by the whole Hopalong Cassidy/Great Bar 20 gimmick which didn't translate into anything at all. Obviously, the name Coppola in the credits couldn't do anything to guarantee success here, even with more than one listed.If you make it to the end of the film, you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions I did. What exactly was the hook with the gloves? What's up with the rodeo scenario? Who was The Stranger supposed to represent? Why did they make this film? I could probably go on but my energy's been drained. Look, there's already a Western called ""The Gunfighter"" from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. Watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad. That one I can recommend.",negative
Elena left this morning. Nine months spent living with her and now it`ll probably be about 2 years till I see her again. Hmph.,negative
"Honestly, I had no idea that Wonka rebranded what I formerly knew as ""SHOCKERS"" to ""Sweet Tarts Chewy Sours,"" but I'm so glad these are still around! You can definitely buy these at some convenience stores (I've seen them at Walgreens now that I know what I'm looking for) however, I highly recommend buying the 24 pack if you love sour candy. Worth it to always have them on hand and save some money buying in bulk🤘",positive
Are use this for my son’s second birthday cupcake toppers. The theme was Dr. Seuss and these were such cute little toppers! They would also be cute for a baby shower,positive
A perfect gift for a older person whom remembers these candiesSame as the original I remember. These are good Charms,positive
"I've reviewed this product before.  Awesome value. I got this for less than 11 dollars per #10  can. Can't beat that. Black bean burger, refried beans, filler for meat loaf, stuffed peppers and chilli. It will easily stretch your protein when times get tough  it will also save you cash and decrease your dependency on red meat.",positive
I put some on  home made dog-food. My dog  loves it so much and always want more.He is picky about his good.,positive
These work fantastic in my baked goods. I bought it earlier before the price went up so it was a good value.,positive
"there's nothing bad i can say about this productall of tinkyada's brand of gluten free pastas all taste really goodthe texture is just right(i like mine al dente-not too soft or too firm)i've made baked macaroni and cheese, fettucine, spaghetti, you name it, it can be done with this brand.i've been on a gluten free diet on and off for a couple of years now and i'm beginning to notice that the regular pastas have a glue-like flavor and texture that i can't stand anymore. you don't realize it because that's what you may be accustomed to. at first when it tried it i couldn't tell the difference between this and regular dry pasta, which is a good thing, but as i began to use this brand more i realized the difference.this is definitely one alternative to going gluten free that i love and even if you're not allergic to gluten you are going to enjoy this (just follow the recommended time span of cooking-i like mine done at 12 minutes).yum, yum!!",positive
Bought as a gift for my wife who loved them!,positive
"I prefer ""High-test"" however when Decaf is needed this is a great choice !",positive
"I have always loved this vodka sauce, so flavorful and smooth/creamy. I am writing this review though for the shipping. This sauce is not available where I live and so I have to order it, which in the past has been problematic. When I opened my package today I was so happy to see that each jar (x4) was individually bubble wrapped and then all 4 packed in a smaller box inside of the shipping box. No damage and everything good! Thank you!!",positive
"The flavor is wow and they are soft gummy bears, unlike the ones that's harder to chew.  Love! Best ones yet",positive
I bought these so they could be easy to pack for my lunch. I usually buy a large bag of Hippeas at Costco. These did not taste nearly as well as those from Costco. They were two months away from the expiration date and tasted stale.,negative

Bought this for my wife.  She loves the flavor and it has helped with her inflammation.  She hasn't felt this good in a while.,positive
We have these at school and they are soooo good 😋,positive
"I bought the Roland Dijon Extra Strong since I like French mustard and the taste is what I am looking for. It is quite spicy/hot, so I use it sparingly. The jar lasts a long time without spoiling, and the price is better than supermarkets. Great bargain.",positive
"After cooking on stovetop which I thought would be an an acceptable amount of time for premade soup, potatoes are still hard. Disappointing!",negative
They arrived as advertised...the cinnamon flavor is AWESOME!  We're in love...,positive
These are too big.  They are cute and look like the picture but they are huge.,negative
Great taste without all the carbs,positive
to bake,positive
I love this pie filling  !  Lucky Leaf brand is so delicious and full of fruit ! I have found that with a lot of other brands you pay for mostly the gelatin and get very little fruit but not this brand  ! I highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking to bake some wonderful desserts  !,positive
"Excellent spelt matzah, it's got a good flavor.",positive
"I’ve has the gummy bears from this brand and has not disappoint me. Got these for my baby shower and tried it, unfortunately the taste wasn’t good and the aftertaste made it worse. Not worth the purchase for these flavors.",negative
"Item was very well seasoned. I usually don’t like exceptionally spicy items, however I tried the regular one and I prefer the spicy, the regular one is too salty. If you do not like the taste of salt being the first thing you taste then this is the better choice even if you don’t like spicy. I will be ordering this again, if I would like a flavorful experience.",positive
These satisfy your need for chips.,positive
"This chicken dish was amazing! When you pour the sauce mix into the pan it is just a pink powder. I had no hopes of it thickening up or of it even being edible. I went to set the table and came back 2 minutes later, it had thickened and looked just like the sweet and sour chicken at a restaurant. We threw in a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and a half can of pineapple chunks to beef it up and add some flavor. I could eat this every week!",positive
"Excellent fruit, was excited to buy after reading the different sugars in the mango",positive
Great coffee with a pleasing aftertaste! Can't beat the price either!,positive
"I used to get these in gas stations as a kid when we were on long road trips.  They are exactly as I remember! A wonderfully sweet and crumbly, melt-in-your-mouth texture with the smokiness of the raw peanuts with their skins.  YUM! A perfect combination for me. And, after all these years, they are still the same.  The price isn't too bad considering how much I love them.  But, for what I paid, it's worth a trip down memory lane!",positive
It isnt easy to find so the cost is a bit high. I was able to get  5lbs from a local ice cream vendor for the same price but now I have 5lbs of Krunch Kote to eat. That is a lot of icecream!,positive
"I bought two boxes of these recently and found it to be very weak in flavor and aroma. Even with two tea bags, it is still very light flavors, one notch above normal hot water. I am not too impressed. Tazo Earl Grey or Harney and Sons Supreme Earl Grey is better for those who prefer something more flavorful.",negative
Great strong coffee.Nice roasted flavor.,positive
Love being able to store tomato paste rather than ruining a can just to use 1 tablespoon!,positive
This is the only bottled water I drink. Love that there’s no mineral flavor just pure water. Was delivered promptly by Alliance,positive

This is an excellent coffee with a lot of flavor without being acidic.,positive
"Now I am a TINY bit lactose intolerant, but milk NEVER gave me such horrible diarrhea ever! I did not have issue with their whole milk whether I bought it in store or on Amazon Fresh. I guess I probably got a contaminated one this time? Every time I drink this, I get really horrible diarrhea and I feel terrible. It took me a while to figure out this was the reason.As shown in pictures, it was delivered on Jan 17, and expiration date is Jan 25. Today is Jan 23. I did not let the bag sit for long before I put everything in my fridge, and the milk tasted normal. It was probably not properly sanitized, or bacteria got in.I'm hoping this is an accident. Buy it at your own risk.",negative
"This coffee has a bold taste.  I enjoy drinking this coffee.On the plus side, there is no plastic.  It is biodegrade.",positive
I purchased the lungo pods and they are supposed to get 4 oz per serving I'm lucky if I get an ounce and a half out of one podThe water flow through the capsule is very weak and as a result it takes forever to make an espresso,negative
Box was opened and taped back together.  There was mold and was slimy!,negative
Great flavor. I'm gonna make a lot of absinthe with this!,positive
"So, it's not low calorie or low sodium, but it's still a good healthy mix and mighty tasty.",positive
"Love these as a quick post gym snack! So yummy and clean ingredients. Only downside is the price, but you’re getting what you pay for.",positive
Perfect for that add a little something to that home made stock! Adds just the right about of yum to any soup!,positive
"Bottle is incredibly big and easy to use. Very disappointed to find that as soon as you use a tad too much, it creates an incredibly bitter aftertaste. It is also not very sweet as opposed to stevia.",negative
"I have had to cut out processed sugar and sugar alcohols. I have some serious cravings for something sweet and found these. The variety pack is perfect to try all flavors and see what I like. I've tried one so far--the vanilla cashew one--and it was DELICIOUS. I'm SO happy, I was going crazy. Will be ordering more. Thank God for companies like this.",positive
"I am very new for roasting coffee beans so it is hard to say about the details of the taste,but I like this bean very much.Also it is affordable so this would be a good product for beginners of coffee roasting like me.",positive
"It looks, smells, and tastes like coffee. It’s pretty cool. I really enjoy the flavor! Makes a great replacement for coffee.",positive
"I had the highest of hope for these noodles. The seasoning was good, but the noodles are gross. They taste like rubber or plastic, no matter how much you boil them. I get they are plant based, but I've had good plant based products before and they were good. These were NOT good and they are too expensive to not taste good.",negative
Very good! I love Ginger Lemon Hibiscus Tea!,positive
Red: best flavor and the go to.Blue: a good change up flavorYellow: great if you like mustard. It’s the most polarizing flavor of the three.,positive
"A bit pricey but high quality halvah. Delicious, and good amount of pistachios. Not as many as pictured though. Comes in a plastic bag, not a container. Not a good look.",positive
Yum love them!!!,positive
Molded almost immediately,negative
Was addicted to the vanilla cupcake flavor when it hit stores earlier this year- this tastes nothing like it! An artificial vanilla flavor at best...  so disappointed.,negative
"I don't like cooking with alot of salt, and this space is HORRIBLE with it. Dying of thirst after one bite.",negative
I loved the fact that these are available on Amazon. They are authentic. My bag arrived beaten up & my chips were stale and broken 😞,negative
"While I can't speak to the caffeine content since I drink coffee from sun up till sun down, the taste makes it all worth it for me. Very strong coffee without being bitter and I don't use paper filters (which can filter out the bitter oils if there were any).  Great roast and I prefer it using a french press but have also used it in my auto drip 10-cup drip pot.",positive
Great for husbands lunch!,positive
"Convenient for travel, it says to mix with 8 ounces of water, but I add it to a 16 ounce bottle of water and the kids love it.",positive
This is the second time we have received a box of coffee pods that result in allowing the grounds to escape the pod and get into the cup.,negative
I'm not too long in this country and I've been looking this kind of corn flour everywhere.  I'm too lucky I've found it. Now I can finally make my favorite corn breads.  Thank you,positive
disolves readily and tastes great,positive
Tasted just as remembered.  Sweet but yet tangy. Loved it!!,positive
These are the best in terms of quality and freshness. They are very large and they aren't as sweet as others. Also I think they are a good value compared with similar ones.,positive
These are tiny not worth it when you can get the same thing in the store for a dollar... what a scam,negative
I love the taste of this chocolate (maybe it's too good).  I definitely eat more than I should but when can you do when it calls your name as you walk by.  It is truly fantastic tasting dark chocolate.,positive
The taste is good but case after after case us NOT properly mixed. Tough swallowing these unproperly mixed cans of products.,negative
"I use these at home and work, no need for refrigeration",positive
the rice seemed dry and the flavor was rather dull,negative
"This stuff is addicting!  Very buttery caramel, great for munching on during a movie!",positive
"I'm very pleased with this variety pack and will order again. I had no plain coffees in mine as a few other reviewers claim.  There is a variety pack that includes flavored AND plain; maybe that's what they ordered thinking they ordered the 100% flavored pack.  Anyway, there was a diverse variety of both flavors and brands, no duplicates, and the packaging was good enough.  All the cups were in a plastic bag within a box. I don't need any fancy packaging, so that was fine with me.  There was no damage to any cups.  I've not noticed that any are expired or approaching an expiration date.  So far, there's none I haven't liked (I'm about 1/2 way through the box).Some brands include: Donut Shop, Crazy Cups, Eko-Cups, Gloria Jean's, Green Mountain, Cinnabon, Brooklyn, Java Factory, Donut House, among others.Some flavors include: Irish Cream, Italian Chocolate Cheesecake (yum), Oh Fudge, Mocha Nut Fudge, Blueberry, Tiramisu Twist, Chocolate Chip Cookie, Coney Island Caramel, Kahlua, and a ton of others.If you're into flavored coffee and aren't looking for fancy packaging, this is a great buy.",positive
"The coffee pods are great, it does make a very strong cup of coffee, so I usually use a glass 16 oz cup . Oh yes it will work in the adapter cup for your Keurig coffee maker, I saw that it said they wouldn't work and then reviews where other people had reviewed and commented about using the maroon adapter for the Keurig Coffee Maker , it works just fine for me.  I think Keurig just wants you to buy their coffee, duh.???",positive
"Shipped in excellent timing, as far as the caffeine boost it's not any stronger than a double shot of coffee for myself. But with saying that I am a very avid coffee drinker so caffeine doesn't have much visible effect for myself. I would defiantly recommend this product though.",positive
"Eating these nuts are really addicting. They taste great plus if you eat a small bit of high cocoa chocolate (85 %) at the same time you  get  such a real treat from the blended tastes.Since I eat low carb and I track my food intake on fitday.com I've noticed my Manganese was not high as I would like.Eating about 10 nuts gives you 43% RDA of this important mineral plus 10 % Vitamin E and 6% Thiamin just to name a few.This serving amount,  only adds to 1.6 carbs to my carbohydrate allowance.carbs 2.3 -  .5 *  fiber 1.4 = 1.6  Not Bad ...Soooo Good!",positive
"Great seller, delicious tea, wonderful buy",positive
"We all would remember these from years gone by in the round slabs of caramel with round icing inside.  The cow tails are the same product from the same company in a cute and easily used stick.  Bursting with that flavor you'll easily remember.  If you don't like cow tails, you're probably in a coma.  Product delivered quickly, packed well and VERY FRESH!  Buy this and you'll be giddy.",positive
"I stumbled across this by accident.Having been a little pudge most of my pre-teen and adult life I am always looking for ways to cut calories.I was out of my favorite Ken's Creamy  Caesar dressing.So quite desperate to stay on my fat losing journey-I measured out the remaining tablespoon of my yummy -but measured, favorite dressing- on my helmetsized low carb salad.I looked in my pantry and eliminated most of the condiments that were there.Until I spied the flavored rice vinegar.Aaha-that may just work I reasoned.Much better than catsup to be sure.So I tried it !And it was sooo good!I do it intentionally now-all the time.Try it.It will make you smile -even if you are not pudgy.I will probably still use it if I EVER get to be thin.It has my seal of approval.",positive
"Just bought my first bottle. This Is hard to beat. Not too hot, but will definitely give you that habanero mouth coating. I have tried more habanero sauces than I could count, but this one has a great quality flavor and at the moment, I am putting it on every single thing I eat. If you like habanero hot sauces, you cant go wrong with this one. I will be ordering more.",positive
"I purchased Pamela's Simplebites ginger mini snaps , there's no ginger taste at all and are to sweet.I must be simple for purchasing  this item.They went in to the trash. NO THANKS GOLDEN BIRD",negative
Did not like flavor and they were not light and crispy.  They were tough to chew.,negative
"This was a present for my mom.  I had it gift wrapped.  She was thrilled.  The gift wrapping was worth the money, and of course, Godiva is always excellent.",positive
great for candy lovers.,positive
"If you've been excited to try a new allegedly spicy sauce only to be left down by a spice level of less than a pinch of black pepper, then you know how hard it can be to find a properly spicy sauce. Mezzetta doesn't disappoint here. Tasty, spicy sauce that's well worth even the inflated $10.99 a third party seller is selling this for on Amazon right now - but you can easily find cheaper elsewhere. As a spice lover I would say it's  on the spicy scale (1 being no spice, 10 being burn your mouth way too spicy). Most would say 7/10. Ultimately as far as quality I'd give this sauce a 9/10. The only flaw is it's a bit too thick and if you're using it for pasta some pasta shapes don't really lend themselves to thicker sauces",positive
If you’re looking for a great tasting coffee at a reasonable price. You’ve found it here!! Great job Maud’s!!,positive
"These are terrible. They ""updated"" the recipe and they are not as good as the original recipe.",negative
"If you have never (or even if you have) tried this tea, you need to purchase some....brew it and enjoy it.  The flavor is astounding  It puts you in a special place of relaxing and enjoying having been given a special gift of contentment! The shipping was fast too, and the bags are inside a metal tin...which women can always find a use for!",positive
"I tried and tried, because, of course they are good for you.  But alas, my children wouldn't eat them.  From the 16 year old on down.  I've tried them too, and they are a bit bland and hard. Can't really blame them, but how am I gonna get rid of these boxes??",negative
"This tea is just so delicious.  It's very flavorful, very fruity.  It almost tastes like a really good juice.  It is wonderful warm, but I bet it's good over ice, as well.",positive
Taste great arrived in great shape.,positive
"This product was amazing during my pregnancy.  I packed it everywhere to aid in my nausea.  It worked beautifully. I haven't used it much since, unless I have an upset stomach, because I'm not a huge ginger fan.  But hey ... if you're suffering from morning sickness or suffer from nausea, this may work perfectly for you as well.",positive
Love using this when making burgers or steaks.,positive
Great product to replace processed sugar.,positive
"Don't bother buying unless the price reduces to 75% off. Cheese portion is ridiculously small. Large price, small delivery. SKIP THIS ONE! Bought for a Christmas present. Was so embarrassed to give as a gift! Per my humiliation, keep on moving. Too bad.",negative
"Buyers - you are paying more than $11 for something you can get for $3 from a grocery store, or $2.50 if it's on sale.  I thought I was ordering a pack of 4 boxes when I bought it.  But it turned out to be one box of 5 packs of 4 biscuits, so 5 servings.  My own mistake.",negative
Great packaging! Great strong coffee! And very prompt shipping!! Thank you,positive
"These are great quality sturdy pics. I used them for an Oklahoma the musical themed party, but these could be used for much more. It came with a cake banner which I put away for a cake another time. Very cute!",positive

"I was have been in the market for some loose teas and figured a variety pack would be the way to go.  I unfortunately did not care for any of these teas.  I may just not be used to loose tea, but I felt they all tasted like perfume.",negative
"This was the perfect variety to take on a camping trip with little kids. It was the perfect combination of high interest and healthier snack food. Not a lot of candy, which was perfect! I will be ordering one of these every time we going on trips, or maybe just to keep around the house!",positive
Raw goodness,positive
"Perfect snack size. No damage to the box, or the goldfish inside. Loved it!",positive
"This is the only Grape Juice in our area that we have been able to find without citric acid added. Thought the Amazon price is steep; it's under $4 for a 32oz. bottle at Walmart, and around $7 a bottle at Hannaford (NH), Market Basket (NH), Lowe's Foods (NC), and Food Lion (NC).",positive
wonderful selection!,positive
We liked the variety.,positive

Would not buy these again. EVER! So oily and an off chemical flavor! I love any olive... this is the first I have met that I would push away!! The idea is a good one.... if it had a real grilled flavor!,negative
Arrived stale. Who knows how long it sat on a shelf before it delivered.,negative

This is my wife's most favorite K Cup coffee. She adds some flavored creamer to make a coffee shop tasting coffee. I love the smell of it brewing though I'm not a coffee drinker. We have purchased this flavor many times and it never disappoints her. Yay!,positive
"I use this to make iced tea for each meal, even breakfast!  The tea quality is above average and has no ""Nestea"" taste--I hate instant tea and can tell it in a heartbeat.  This single person quantity of iced tea works great and I don't have a half pitcher of normally brewed tea go ""off"" before I can finish it.  The iced tea is fresh for each meal.  I just brew it on the largest setting for the Keurig without ice using a 4 cup measuring cup.  After brewing, I add about a cup of ice to the measuring cup and use it as my table pitcher.  It is fairly strong right out of the machine so a little water in the glass before pouring in the tea makes it just the right consistency.",positive
"Absolutely love these! I can’t find them anywhere around where we live anymore so I started ordering them! They are a lot fresher than they were in store!! I order them every month. Me, my husband, and our children love them! Going to continue to order!!",positive
"I've been using this flavoring in protein drinks and hot chocolate.  It is awesome!  One of these days, I'll have to give it a try in some baked goods as well.  It smells and tastes just like the real deal.  It is very yummy, and my kids love it, too.",positive
Dark chocolate is yummy. An enjoyable drink when I have a chocolate craving.,positive
The product was leaking and half of the product was missing,negative
"Almost as great as the real thing, but with far less fat. I use it in baking and anywhere else you would usually use peanut butter. I am very happy with the taste and texture. I will continue to buy this.",positive
Probably the only brand of glass noodles to buy. A class above the rest. Until they poison it as well. Or fake the packaging  or at least get it dusted. . . Glass noodles are the best!,positive
"NECCO bought Clark Bar a while ago.  I believe the formulation has changed from the original because I remember the original Clark Bars being better than what NECCO produces, although I still love 'em.from NECCO:[....]By 1920 the D.L. Clark Company was making about 150 different types of candy, including several five-cent bars, specialty items and a bulk candy line. Clark also manufactured chewing gum and in 1921 incorporated the Clark Brothers Chewing Gum Company, makers of Teaberry and Tendermint. However, by 1931, the candy bar business had grown so large that Clark decided to specialize exclusively in candy bars.In 1955, the Clark family sold their candy business to the Beatrice Food Company, which operated the company until 1983.In 1983, Leaf, Inc., which operated 11 candy and gum plants in the United States, acquired the confectionery division of Beatrice foods, including Clark. When Leaf, Inc. announced plans to move the candy operations from Pittsburgh, the city protested. The candy plant and rights to Clark, Slo Poke and Black Cow were sold, and D.L. Clark became part of the Pittsburgh Food and Beverage Company. After a period of financial instability, the company was again sold in June of 1995. The Company was renamed Clark Bar America and distribution was re-established. New product lines were also selectively introduced including Winter Clark, Clark Dark, and the Yoo-hoo Candy Bar.However, Clark Bar America again fell into financial difficulty and in May of 1999, New England Confectionery Company purchased the assets of Clark Bar America.",positive

Coconut oil is fantastic for most everything...from head to toe...from kitchen to bathroom.  I love this brand for it's neutral taste (no coconutty smell) and great value.,positive

"This is absolutely the biggest waste of money purchase I have ever made.  The photo clearly shows green and pink peppermints in the bag and this was the one reason I paid the absolutely ridiculous price of $14.00 plus for this tiny bag of candy.  There was not even one piece of pink candy in the bag.  I am extremely unhappy with Brach's for this deceptive advertising.  Really, really deceptive!!!",negative

"It's so nice to have the taste of strawberries in the middle of winter, winter strawberries in supermarkets are mostly flavorless, but this product would actually be great to use year round. It makes wonderful smoothies and is divine in baked goods, like strawberry cupcakes. Bright red in color, it's beautiful and it adds natural color to whatever you put it in. Strawberries can have a lot of pesticides, which makes it especially good that this product is organic.",positive
New to this but enjoying it so far. Many possibilities and simplifies my morning while saving money.,positive
So they are slightly cheaper than on sale at the grocery store.  They come in a box loose.,positive
"I am so impressed with this product - husband is undergoing radiation tx for prostate cancer and can have NO caffeine,  HE LOVES COFFEE AND CHOCOLATE!  This smells like and tastes similar to coffee and with a bit of cream and sprinkled with some carob, BINGO! instant latte or cappucino.  This is a Godsend for him and I love it too.",positive
"I received this free from Influenster on behalf of belVita to try and review honestly. It was egg-free and I let my kiddo try a nibble but he wasn't too excited, so yay, I get to eat it! I have to tell you it tasted really good, like a cookie but more substantial and healthy than that. It kept me going for quite awhile.",positive
This is a great buy & love this Coffee.  No issues.  Would purchase again.  A lot cheaper than store price.,positive
Kids love these.  Item arrived promptly.,positive
"Yum! I wanted these for the strawberry and watermelon fflavors and I was not disappointed. I had 81 pieces of candy in my bag. I had 26 pieces of Strawberry, 25 pieces of Watermelon, 10 fruit punch, a 20 cherry pieces of candy. I'm glad there was only 10 fruit punch cause I did not like that flavor at all, and the cherry was okay. I got my money's worth and was pleased. I would but these again.",positive
"This is better than brewed chai, as far as I'm concerned. The Natrure's Guru Cardamom Chai is great, too, I go back and forth between them.  I like to add a little stevia and then almond milk to adjust the temperature, but it's not necessary.",positive
This is that good old fashioned southern melt in your mouth mints. You might be able to find it cheaper at a dollar store. But it is worth the purchase.,positive
"Just new into the whole bean thing. These beans came very fast, first thing they came I immediately ground some and brewed a pot! Tastes great!!",positive
"This was really gross. It tasted old and burned. I couldn’t finish the cup, and neither could my partner. I ended up throwing the whole bag away. I’d bought it once before and didn’t remember it being so bad, so I don’t know if I got a bad batch this time, or if it’s changed. Either way, the batch we got was undrinkable, and its too expensive to be worth the risk of getting such a bad batch.",negative

I love these little chips. I bought them in a health food store a long time ago. When I found them thru amazon I was thrilled. They are so very effective. Great to have on hand. I received them in a timely manner.,positive

Tried this with my novelty home cotton candy machine and it worked wonders!  The flavor was spot-on - just like what you'd get at a fair or carnival.  The sheer volume of sugar here appears like it will last us a long time - can't wait to break this out for house parties and coworkers!,positive
"These are the best packaged mashed potatoes, much better than any other ""artifical"" prepared mashed potatoes.  I highly recommend you mix it with either Chicken or Beef Broth, they add great flavor to the mashed potatoes like you have never had before!",positive
These could be addictive. Definitely would recommend.,positive
I have a Chicken Biryani recipe I learned to make in Africa and it calls for 1/4 teaspoon Fenugreek. Of course it is impossible to find in a store near me and ordering at amazon is so convenient. With Prime it arrived in a day! So I made the biryani and it was delicious.I'd say this spice balances out other flavors and can be combined with many other spices in Indian food. If you taste it straight from the jar it is bitter and creamy. But in a recipe it adds just the right flavor elements. I look forward to finding other recipes using this spice.~The Rebecca Review,positive
This is my favorite non dairy nacho cheese! My store stopped carrying it and was so happy when I found it here! Will continue to buy.,positive
Cadbury! Not like a Hershey bar. They have a different flavor and soother texture that melts in your mouth (and hands) much easier (which makes it yummier). Reminded me of my trip to Britain where you see them everywhere.,positive
"For whatever reason I find these lil bars awesome and delicious. Im addicted. They have a similar texture to a fig newton but the taste is very vibrant clean blueberry. Its light and healthy for ya, better than those other gross protein bars you probably have. Pick these up and give them a try. Plus they're vegan for all ya hippies JK",positive
New to this cereal. Can’t wait to try,positive
"Sooo good! Happie FoodI was fresh, healthy and easy to enjoy. I will be a repeat customer.",positive
I have ordered similar variety boxes before but this one really impressed me. I love a super sugary flavored coffee. I want to drink liquid doughnuts and cookies. This is exactly what you get. The taste is bold and works perfect in my keurig slim. I was especially excited to see minimal coconut flavors as I personally dislike them. I can't wait to use the Christmas flavors like Peppermint and sugar cookie since it is December! Will definitely order again!,positive
These came in a quick serve box and were individually wrapped for easy gift giving. They tasted fresh and were yummy good,positive

"Marich licorise pastels are the best on the market in my opinion.  The candy coating is thicker than Goelitz's (Jelly Bellys), and the licorise flavor is mellower and more pleasing so doesn't dominate over the candy coating flavor.  Candy maker Mr. Marich left Goelitz years ago and took his superior skills with him - imho.",positive
I bought this to do some DIYs. I am not sure about the flavor but it does carry a nice scent and makes a strong tea.,positive

"I bought this because of the soups I've had by Pacific, most are great... the broths are bleh, too weak and watery, but the tomato ones and *the new veggie lentil and roasted red pepper mmm* are souper-duper.First, the texture... a mix of rice flour thickened broth and creme fraiche and milk, it had separated so one section was clear goopy broth and the other was the creamy-ish part (more starchy than creamy, like potatoes--in this case rice flour--blended with some broth and skim milk, nothing like Campbell's, not condensed enough to work for recipes that need a thick base). I got it when it was a brand new product line by them (new enough to get $1 off coupons, the REAL reason I tried them since they were barely over a dollar after the discount).The smell I agree with the 1-star review is really off putting... and it matches the taste PERFECTLY.What the taste IS? BABY FOOD. JUST LIKE BABY FOOD.When I got the lentil one with the coupon, I only got one... then went back and got the rest, along with a few of these (I haven't braved the mushroom yet). I wish I'd only gotten one. A dollar and change or not, NO WAY am I keeping them. I wouldn't even donate them. I added ground pepper... nope, baby food plus pepper. Sea salt made a bite of it almost edible--yknow, thick salty broth--and adding a touch of herbs just ruined the herbs.The reason it can't be salvaged? Their chicken is repulsive. I'm almost sure they boiled the bird, and that is only acceptable for broth where the bird gets removed. In fact, I have a hunch--especially given the whole thing possessed ONE tiny flaky pea sized square of meat--they got ""responsible"" and took the bird etc used for the broth--the broth strained out and packaged--and just blended that boiled limp weird-odor meat and such and tossed in some rice flour and dairy to try passing it for soup.Ever made your own broth, the kind where you boil it til the bird is almost Michael Jackson white because you aren't going to use it as part of the dish and want to yank all its flavor out? You know how funky boiled, denatured bird smells and tastes? This is that bird. Now I have finally figured out why baby food is so repulsive, a mystery I was content to never even ponder. I hate that I am dumping the remaining 90% of this out, but I'll be tasting it coming back up if I don't (4 tiny spoonfuls and it already has me belchy and nauseous!). Healthy shouldn't have to taste like wartime rations, not in this day and age.",negative
"I love this product.  I often use it in shakes, but lately, have taken to freezing it and bringing it into my car while I am driving around and as it melts, it remains cold all day. I just got it through TSA before a long flight because it was frozen.  I find that it is not only refreshing, but keeps me feeling energized and like my electrolytes are in balance. Great product and reliable company.",positive

This stuff is great.  Sweet and spicy with a smoky flavor.  I love it.  Thanks shipping so quickly.,positive
"NOT JUST BROKEN IN HALF, AS PICTURED BY ANOTHER BUYER, BUT CRUSHED AS IN DEMOLISHED!! They'd been doing so well, & then this!!I love these, but the pieces are too small to even pick up & dunk. I mean like they've been intentionally beat up. Just one roll of a rolling pin more & they be crumb-crust material. Makes me sad. Really. Such good cookies to be badly treated like that.I hadn't seen Windmill cookies for a while & they've always been a favorite. These have natural ingredients & the spice is fresh, you can tell. They have the texture of a butter cookie, so not hard like some, but hold together for a quick dip in my coffee or tea. I hesitated to buy 5 pkgs, not knowing if they'd be good as I remembered...but they were better! I have to ""allot"" them out, or I'll eat too many!EDIT: They've gone up in price and getting to me in pieces & I don't mean halves, or quartered, but crushed. Not just one pkg, but most. Maybe fine for pie crusts, but not for ordinary eating & certainly not for serving others. I  took off two stars, in hopes they'll do better in shipping/handling of them~Whoever's responsible. The taste is fine, but I don't buy them to just add to my morning oatmeal.",negative

"Perfect replacement for sugar: no aftertaste at all, doesn’t raise blood sugar and it bakes and taste like real sugar. I was even able to make lollipops with it and it behaved almost like sugar (was a bit more runny) but overall it’s great. It’s just really expensive!",positive

"I have purchased these Martinis olives from Super Olive several times over the last few years and they are always fabulous! These - the pitted black kalamatas - are my favorite, but the green olives are great, too. And so are the ones with pits. The flavor is awesome. I eat them with my Greek Salads, stuffed with feta or blue cheese, as an appetizer. Simply delicious! The seller is also great! The olives are packed with care, and if there is ever an issue, the seller is extremely responsive. You can't go wrong here. Yum!",positive
The box was inspected 6/22. Having been in the Army for a few year I love and hate mres. Bur since I work in law enforcement now and lunches can be very difficult.

"We cooked them as instructed, longer for crispy.....????  Very soggy, mushy, and not appetizing at all after all that.  YUK!  No, DOUBLE YUK!!!  Eight pieces and seven were drumettes.  Here's an idea, buy them for dog food.  Maybe not, they're too spicy for an animal,  not even a good spicy, and they probably wouldn't eat them anyway.  I will never buy this very poor excuse for food ever again and really want my money back.",negative
"First, I rarely write reviews but this product was so disgustingly bad I felt the need to let others know.  I used it once (and sparingly) to make tuna salad and ended up throwing it out, along with the tuna salad.  I kept trying to doctor up the salad and nothing helped.  So, not only was the taste gross, but the texture was gelatinous -- it didn't wasn't smooth or creamy -- kind of like hard jello.  I highly recommend you do not buy this product.",negative

"I recently found these products on Amazon and immediately ordered them. The first time I tried all three flavors was at the Linden Hills Co-op, but live too far away to shop there regularly. My favorite is the Truffle Herb Walnut, but all three (including Spiced Maple Pecan and Sundried Basil Cashew) are satisfying for my desire to include more healthy tree nuts in my diet without the added sugar and other additives of some of the others on the market. I love the spreads on grilled veggies, apples & pears, and kicking up the flavor of a grilled burger or chicken breast. I personally don't have issues with gluten, but if you are worried, these are gluten, soy and palm oil free - containing good, simple, quality ingredients. Good. Simple. Quality.",positive
